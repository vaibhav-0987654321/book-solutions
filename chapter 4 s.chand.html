<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 1</span></strong><br />
Mass = m<br />
Height above the ground = h<br />
Work done = Potential energy acquired by the body = m x g x h<br />
where g is acceleration due to gravity<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 2</span></strong><br />
SI unit of work is Joule (J).<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 3</span></strong><br />
Work is a scalar quantity.<br />
Work, as a physical quantity, requires only magnitude to be represented. Hence, it is scalar quantity.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 4</span></strong><br />
When a force of 1 newton moves a body through a distance of 1 metre in its own direction, then the work done is known as 1 joule.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 5</span></strong><br />
The condition for a force to do work on a body is that it should produce motion in the body.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 6</span></strong><br />
Energy is a scalar quantity. It has only magnitude but no direction.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 7</span></strong><br />
a)Unit of work is joule.<br />
b) Unit of energy is joule.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 8</span></strong><br />
The work done against gravity is zero when a body is moved horizontally along a frictionless surface because force of gravity acts perpendicular to the direction of motion.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 9</span></strong><br />
Kinetic energy will become four times when the speed is doubled because kinetic<br />
energy is directly proportional to square of speed of the body<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 11</span></strong><br />
Kinetic<br />
energy will become one-fourth when the speed is halved because kinetic energy<br />
is directly proportional to square of speed of the body<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 16</span></strong><br />
Let masses of body A and B be m<br />
Height of body A = h<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 18</span></strong><br />
Potential energy is a scalar quantity as it has magnitude only and it does not require any specification of direction.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 19</span></strong><br />
Mass = 100 kg<br />
Height = 5 m<br />
g = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup><br />
P.E. = m x g x h = 100 x 5 x 9.8 = 4900 J<br />
Work done is equal to PE acquired by the body.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 20</span></strong><br />
False.<br />
PE = m x g x h<br />
= 1 x 9.8 x 1 = 9.8 J<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 21</span></strong><br />
The potential energy is doubled when the height is doubled since potential energy is directly proportional to height, h to which body is raised.<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 24</span></strong><br />
The work done by a force on a body depends on two factors<br />
a) magnitude of force<br />
b) distance through which the body moves<br />
Work done is directly proportional to the force applied and the distance through which the body moves.<br />
W = F x s<br />
where W is work done, F is force applied and s is distance through which the body moves.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 25</span></strong><br />
Yes, it is possible that a force is acting on a body but still work done is zero. For example, in the case of a man pushing a wall, the work done is zero despite of non-zero force, sin ce there is no displacement of the wall.</p>

a)The change of one form of energy into another form of energy is known as transformation of energy, e.g. in a cell chemical energy is transformed into<br />
electrical energy<br />
b) a. When a ball is thrown upwards its kinetic energy gradually converts into potential energy and potential energy<br />
becomes maximum at the maximum height attained by the ball<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 32</span></strong><br />
a) Law of conservation of energy states that whenever energy changes from one form to another form, the total amount of energy remains constant. Energy can<br />
never be created nor destroyed, it transforms from one form to another. For example, when electrical energy is converted into light energy in an electric<br />
bulb, then some energy is wasted as heat during conversion but the total energy remains the same.<br />
b) Initially the pendulum is at rest. The bob is pulled to one side to position B to give it potential energy due to higher position of B and then released, the bob<br />
starts swinging<br />
i. When the bob is at position B, it has potential energy but no kinetic energy<br />
ii. As the bob starts moving down from position B to A, its potential energy starts decreasing and kinetic energy starts increasing<br />
iii. When the bob is at position A, it has maximum kinetic energy and zero potential energy<br />
iv. As the bob starts moving down from position A to C, its kinetic energy starts decreasing and potential energy starts increasing<br />
v. On reaching the extreme position C, the bob stops for a very small instant of time and bob maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy.<br />
Therefore at extreme positions B and C bob has only potential energy and at A it has only kinetic energy and at other intermediate positions bob has both kinetic<br />
and potential energy. Thus the total energy of the pendulum is same for any instant of time (conserved)<br />
