What type of motion, uniform or non-uniform, is exhibited by a freely falling body ? Give reason for your solution.<br />
<span style="color: #yellow;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
A freely falling body has non-uniform motion because it covers smaller distances in the initial &#8216;1 second&#8217; intervals and larger distances in the later &#8216;1 second&#8217; intervals, i.e., it covers unequal distances in equal intervals of time.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow;"><strong>Question 22:</strong></span><br />
State whether speed is a scalar or a vector quantity. Give reason for your choice.<br />
<span style="color: #yellow;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Speed is a scalar quantity as it has magnitude only, it has no specified direction.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow;"><strong>Question 23:</strong></span><br />

Speed of bus X is more than that of bus Y. Hence, bus X travels faster.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow;"><strong>Question 24:</strong></span><br />
Arrange the following speeds in increasing order (keeping the least speed first):</p>
<ol>
<li>An athlete running with a speed of 10 m/s.</li>
<li>A bicycle moving with a speed of 200 m/min.</li>
<li>A scooter moving with a speed of 30 km/h.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #yellow;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Speed of athelete = 10 m/s<br />
Speed of bicycle = 200 m/min = 200/60 m/s = 3.33 m/s<br />
Speed of scooter = 30 km/h = 30000/3600 m/s = 8.33 m/s<br />
3.33 m/s &lt; 8.33 m/s &lt; 10 m/s<br />
i.e. 200 m/min &lt; 30 km/h &lt; 10 m/s</p>

<span style="color: #yellow;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) Acceleration<br />
(b) Retardation<br />
(c) No, because if a body takes a round trip such that its final position is same as the starting position, then the displacement of the body is zero but the distance travelled is non-zero.</p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"><strong>Question 32:</strong></span><br />
An aircraft travelling at 600 km/h accelerates steadily at 10 km/h per second. Taking the speed of sound as 1100 km/h at the aircraft&#8217;s altitude, how long will it take to reach the &#8216;sound barrier&#8217; ?<br />
<span style="color: #yellow;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Initial velocity, u = 600 km/h<br />
Final velocity, v = 1100 km/h<br />
Acceleration = 10 km/h/s = 600 km/h<sup>2</sup><br />
From relation, a = (v-u)/t<br />
t = (v-u)/a<br />
t = (1100-600)/600 = 500/600 = 5/6 hr = 50 sec</p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"><strong>Question 35:</strong></span><br />
Define motion. What do you understand by the terms &#8216;uniform motion&#8217; and &#8216;non-uniform motion&#8217; ? Explain with examples.<br />
(a) Define speed. What is the SI unit of speed ?<br />
(b) What is meant by (i) average speed, and (ii) uniform speed ?<br />
<span style="color: #yellow;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
A body is said to be in motion when its position changes continuously with respect to a stationary object taken as reference point.<br />
A body has uniform motion if it travels equal distances in equal intervals of time, no matter how small these time intervals may be. For example: a car running at a constant speed of 10m/s, will cover equal distance of 10m every second, so its motion will be uniform.<br />
Non-uniform motion: A body has a non-uniform motion if it travels unequal distances in equal intervals of time. For example: dropping a ball from the roof of a tall building .</p>

<span style="color: #yellow;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) Speed of a body is the distance travelled by it per unit time. The SI unit of speed is m/s.<br />
(b) (i) Average speed of a body is the total distance travelled divided by the total time taken to cover this distance.<br />
(ii) Uniform speed refers to the constant speed of a moving body. A body has a uniform speed if it travels equal distance in equal intervals of time, no matter how small these time intervals may be.<br />

( b)(i)Speed is a scalar quantity whereas velocity is a vector quantity.<br />
(ii) Speed of a body is distance travelled by it per unit time whereas velocity of a body is the distance travelled by it per unit time in a given direction.<br />
(iii)Speed is always positive whereas velocity can be both positive as well as negative.<br />
(c) Speed = 54km/h = 54 x (1000/3600) = 15m/s</p>

<span style="color: #yellow;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Uniform linear motion is uniform motion along a linear path or a straight line. T he direction of motion is fixed. So, it is not accelerated. For e.g.: a car running with uniform speed of 10km/hr on a straight road.<br />
Uniform circular motion is uniform motion along a circular path. T he direction of motion changes continuously. So, it is accelerated. For e.g.: motion of earth around the sun.</p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"><strong>Question 38:<br />
</strong></span>Show by means of graphical method that: v = u + at, where the symbols have their usual meanings.<br />
<span style="color: #yellow;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Consider the velocity-time graph of a body shown in figure.<br />
The body has an initial velocity u at a point A and then its velocity changes at a uniform rate from A to B in time t. In other words, there is a uniform acceleration a from A to B, and after time t its final velocity becomes v which is equal to BC in the graph. The time t is represented by OC. To complete the figure, we draw the perpendicular CB from point C, and draw AD parallel to OC. BE is the perpendicular from point B to OE.<br />
Now, Initial velocity of the body, u= OA &#8212;&#8211;(1)<br />
And,Final velocity of the body, v=BC &#8212;&#8212;(2)<br />
But from the graph BC =BD + DC<br />
Therefore, v=BD + DC &#8212;&#8212;(3)<br />
Again DC = OA<br />
So,v =BD + OA<br />
Now, from equation (1), OA =u<br />
So, v=BD + u &#8212;&#8212;(4)<br />
We should find out the value of BD now. We know the slope of a velocity-time graph is equal to the acceleration, a.<br />
Thus,Acceleration, a= slope of line AB<br />
<sub>or a = BD/AD</sub><br />
But AD =OC= t, so putting t in place of AD in the above relation, we get:<br />
or BD=at<br />
Now, putting this value of BD in equation(4), we get:<br />
v= u+ at<br />

Consider the velocity-time graph of a body shown in figure. The body has an initial velocity u at a point A and then its velocity changes at a uniform rate from A to B in time t. In other words, there is a uniform acceleration a from A to B, and after time t its final velocity becomes v which is equal to BC in the graph. The time t is represented by OC.<br />
Suppose the body travels a distance s in time t. In the figure, the distance travelled by the body is given by the area of the space between the velocity-time graph AB and the time axis OC, which is equal to the area of the figure OABC. Thus:<br />
Distance travelled = Area of figure OABC<br />

Now, we will find out the area of rectangle OADC and area of triangle ABD.<br />
(i) Area of rectangle OADC =OA x OC<br />

<p><span style="color: yellow;"><strong>Question 40:<br />
</strong></span>Derive the following equation of motion by the graphical method : v<sup>2</sup> = u<sup>2</sup> + 2as, where the symbols have their usual meanings.<br />
<span style="color: #yellow;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Consider the velocity-time graph of a body shown in figure. The body has an initial velocity u at a point A and then its velocity changes at a uniform rate from A to B in time t. In other words, there is a uniform acceleration a from A to B, and after time t its final velocity becomes v which is equal to BC in the graph. The time t is represented by OC. To complete the figure, we draw the perpendicular CB from point C, and draw AD parallel to OC. BE is the perpendicular from point B to OE.<br />
The distance travelled s by a body in time t is given by the area of the figure OABC which is a trapezium.<br />
Distance travelled, s= Area of trapezium OABC<br />
Now, OA + CB = u + v and OC =t Putting these values in the above relation, we get:<br />
Eliminate t from the above equation. This can be done by obtaining the value of t from the first equation of motion.<br />
