<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) No, the value of acceleration due to gravity (g) is not constant at all the places on the surface of the earth. Since the radius of the earth is minimum at the poles and maximum at the equator, the value of g is maximum at the poles and minimum at the equator. As we go up from the surface of the earth, the distance from the centre of the earth increases and hence the value of g decreases. The value of g also decreases as we go down inside the earth.<br />

</strong></span>State and explain Kepler&#8217;s laws of planetary motion. Draw diagrams to illustrate these laws.<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Kepler&#8217;s first law: The planets move in elliptical orbits around the sun, with the sun at one of the two foci of the elliptical orbit. This law means that the orbit of a planet around the sun is an ellipse and not an exact circle. An elliptical path has two foci, and the sun is at one of the two foci of the elliptical path.<br />
Kepler&#8217;s Second law states that: Each planet revolves around the sun in such a way that the line joining the planet to the sun sweeps over equal areas in equal intervals of time. This means that a planet does not move with constant speed around the sun. The speed is greater when the planet is nearer the sun, and less when the planet is farther away from the sun.<br />
Kepler&#8217;s Third Law states that: The cube of the mean distance of a planet from the sun is directly proportional to the square of time it takes to move around the sun.<br />

<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
In order to be able to notice the gravitational force of attraction between any two objects, at least one of the objects on the earth should have an extremely large mass. Since no object on the earth have an extremely large mass, we cannot notice such forces.<br />
The two objects in a room do not move towards each other because due to their small masses, the gravitational force of attraction between them is very, very weak.</p>

The mass of a stone is very small, due to which the gravitational force produces a large acceleration in it. Due to large acceleration of stone, we see stone falling towards the earth. The mass of earth is, however, very, very large. Due to the very large mass of the earth, the same gravitational force produces very, very small acceleration in the earth, that it cannot be observed.

<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
A wide steel belt is<br />

<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
The tip of the sewing needle is sharp so that due to its sharp tip, the needle may put the force on a very small area of the cloth, producing a large pressure sufficient to pierce the cloth being stitched.</p>

</strong></span>When is the pressure on the ground more‚Äîwhen a man is walking or when a man is standing ? Explain.<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
When a man is walking, then at one time only one foot is on the ground. Due to this, the force of weight of man falls on a smaller area of the ground and produces more pressure on the ground. On the other hand, when the man is standing, then both his feet are on the ground. Due to this, the weight of the man falls on a larger area of the ground and produces lesser pressure on the ground.</p>

Explain why, snow shoes stop you from sinking into soft snow.<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Snow shoes stop us from sinking into soft snow because due to large area of snow shoes, our weight is spread over a large area of the snow producing small pressure.</p>

Explain why, when a person stands on a cushion, the depression is much more than when he lies down on it.<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
When a person stands on a cushion then only his two feet (having small area) are in contact with the cushion. Due to this the weight of man falls on a small area of the cushion producing a large pressure causing a big depression in the cushion. On the other hand, when the same person lies down on the cushion, then his whole body (having large area) is in contact with the cushion. Here, his weight falls on a much larger area of the cushion producing much smaller pressure and very little depression in the cushion.</p>

Use your ideas about pressure to explain why it is easier to walk on soft sand if you have flat shoes rather than shoes with sharp heels.<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Flat shoes have greater area in contact with the soft sand as compared to heels. Due to this, there is less pressure on soft sand because of which they do not sink much in the sand and it is easy to walk on it.</p>

<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
A nail has a pointed tip, so that when it is hammered, the force of hammer is transferred to a very small area of wood creating a large pressure which pushes the nail into the wood.</p>

Why does a ship made of iron and steel float in water whereas a small piece of iron sinks in it ?<br />
<img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4295/36239162945_1d12d95528_o.jpg" alt="lakhmir-singh-physics-class-9-solutions-chapter-3-gravitation-6" width="296" height="224" /><br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
A ship made of iron and steel is a hollow object which contains a lot of air in it. Due to the presence of a lot of air in it, the average density of the ship becomes less than the density of water. Hence a ship floats in water.<br />
On the other hand, a piece of iron is denser than water, so it sinks in water.</p>

<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Camels have large flat feet so that there is a greater area in contact with the sand which produces less pressure on the sand and the camels can move easily on the sand.</p>

The object will weigh less in water because an upward force (buoyant force) equal to the weight of water displaced acts on the object when immersed in water which reduces its weight apparently.</p>

<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) The upward force acting on an object immersed in a liquid is called buoyant force.<br />
Factors affecting buoyant force:<br />
(i) Volume of object immersed in the liquid,<br />
(ii) Density of the liquid.<br />
(b) The cause of buoyant force is the greater upward pressure exerted by water underneath the object..<br />
(c) Mass of water displaced = 600kg<br />
Weight of water displaced, W =m x g<br />

<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
The two equal weights of unequal volumes which are balanced in air, will get imbalanced when they are completely dipped in water because due to their unequal volumes, they will displace unequal volumes of water and hence suffer unequal loss in weight.</p>

<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
No, it is not necessary that their weights in air should also be the same. This is because the two bodies have undergone the same loss in weight on completely immersing in water due to their equal volumes and not because of their equal weights, so they may have different weights in air.</p>

<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
The body will sink less in water. This is because the density of water is more than that of kerosene due to which water will exert a greater upward buoyant force on the body.</p>

The sheet of tin sinks in water because the density of tin is higher than that of water.
