Law of conservation of mass by LAVOISIER states that: &#8220;Mass can neither be created nor be destroyed in a chemical reaction&#8221;. So, in a chemical reaction, the total mass of reactants must be equal to the total mass of products.<br />
For example: When calcium carbonate is heated, a chemical reaction takes place to form calcium oxide and calcium carbonate. If 100 gms of calcium carbonate is decomposed completely, then 56 gms of calcium oxide and 44 gms of carbon dioxide are formed.<br />
In the above example: the total mass of products = 56 gms (CaO) + 44gms (CO2) = 100 gms.<br />
As total mass of products is equal to the total mass of reactant so, the law of conservation of mass is satisfied.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 52</span><br />
Law of constant proportion given by PROUST states that &#8220;A chemical compound always consists of the same elements combined together in the same proportion by mass.&#8221;<br />
For example: If we decompose 100 gms of pure water by passing electricity through it, then 11 gms of hydrogen and 89 gms of oxygen are obtained. Now, if we repeat this experiment by taking pure water from different sources (like river, sea, well, etc.), the same masses of hydrogen and oxygen elements are obtained in each case. They are always combined together in the same constant proportion of 11:89 or 1:8 by mass. And this is the law of constant proportions.<br />

a) An atom is the smallest particle of an element that can take part in a chemical reaction. They usually exist in combination with the atoms of same element or another element.<br />
b) A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms chemically bonded together.<br />
For example- Ozone gas has three oxygen atoms combined together, so ozone exists in the form of O3 molecule.<br />
c) The molecule of an element contains two or more similar atoms chemically bonded together.<br />
For example- A molecule of hydrogen element consists of 2 hydrogen atoms combined together.<br />
Whereas the molecule of compound contains two or more different type of atoms chemically bonded together.<br />
For example- The molecule of hydrogen chloride(HCl) contains two different type of atoms, i.e. H and Cl.<br />

(b) Calculate the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of a satellite having a mass of 7.4 x 10<sup>22</sup> kg and a radius of 1.74 x 10<sup>6</sup> m (G = 6.7 x 10<sup>-11</sup> Nm<sup>2</sup>/kg<sup>2</sup>). Which satellite do you think it could be ?<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) No, the value of acceleration due to gravity (g) is not constant at all the places on the surface of the earth. Since the radius of the earth is minimum at the poles and maximum at the equator, the value of g is maximum at the poles and minimum at the equator. As we go up from the surface of the earth, the distance from the centre of the earth increases and hence the value of g decreases. The value of g also decreases as we go down inside the earth.<br />

<p><span style="color: yellow ;"><strong>Question 54:<br />
</strong></span>State and explain Kepler&#8217;s laws of planetary motion. Draw diagrams to illustrate these laws.<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Kepler&#8217;s first law: The planets move in elliptical orbits around the sun, with the sun at one of the two foci of the elliptical orbit. This law means that the orbit of a planet around the sun is an ellipse and not an exact circle. An elliptical path has two foci, and the sun is at one of the two foci of the elliptical path.<br />
Kepler&#8217;s Second law states that: Each planet revolves around the sun in such a way that the line joining the planet to the sun sweeps over equal areas in equal intervals of time. This means that a planet does not move with constant speed around the sun. The speed is greater when the planet is nearer the sun, and less when the planet is farther away from the sun.<br />
Kepler&#8217;s Third Law states that: The cube of the mean distance of a planet from the sun is directly proportional to the square of time it takes to move around the sun.<br />

<p><span style="color: yellow ;"><strong>Question 71:<br />
</strong></span>If the distance between two masses is increased by a factor of 5, by what factor would the mass of one of them have to be altered to maintain the same gravitational force ? Would this be an increase or decrease in the mass ?<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Gravitational force is given by:<br />

Hence one of the masses should be increased by 25 times in order to have the same gravitational force.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow ;"><strong>Question 72:<br />
</strong></span>Universal law of gravitation states that every object exerts a gravitational force of attraction on every other object. If this is true, why don&#8217;t we notice such forces ? Why don&#8217;t the two objects in a room move towards each other due to this force ?<br />

<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
In order to be able to notice the gravitational force of attraction between any two objects, at least one of the objects on the earth should have an extremely large mass. Since no object on the earth have an extremely large mass, we cannot notice such forces.<br />
The two objects in a room do not move towards each other because due to their small masses, the gravitational force of attraction between them is very, very weak.</p>

<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
The coin reaches the ground first as compared to the piece of paper because it experiences lesser resistance from air than that felt by paper.<br />

</strong></span>A stone and the earth attract each other with an equal and opposite force. Why then we see only the stone falling towards the earth but not the earth rising towards the stone ?<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
The mass of a stone is very small, due to which the gravitational force produces a large acceleration in it. Due to large acceleration of stone, we see stone falling towards the earth. The mass of earth is, however, very, very large. Due to the very large mass of the earth, the same gravitational force produces very, very small acceleration in the earth, that it cannot be observed. And hence we do not see the earth rising up towards the stone.</p>

<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
The actual shape of the orbit of a planet around the sun is elliptical. The assumption made by the Newton regarding the shape of an orbit of a planet around the sun was that the orbit of a planet around the sun is &#8216;circular&#8217;.</p>

<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
When a man is walking, then at one time only one foot is on the ground. Due to this, the force of weight of man falls on a smaller area of the ground and produces more pressure on the ground. On the other hand, when the man is standing, then both his feet are on the ground. Due to this, the weight of the man falls on a larger area of the ground and produces lesser pressure on the ground.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow ;"><strong>Question 42:</strong></span><br />
Explain why, snow shoes stop you from sinking into soft snow.<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Snow shoes stop us from sinking into soft snow because due to large area of snow shoes, our weight is spread over a large area of the snow producing small pressure.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow ;"><strong>Question 43:</strong></span><br />
Explain why, when a person stands on a cushion, the depression is much more than when he lies down on it.<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
When a person stands on a cushion then only his two feet (having small area) are in contact with the cushion. Due to this the weight of man falls on a small area of the cushion producing a large pressure causing a big depression in the cushion. On the other hand, when the same person lies down on the cushion, then his whole body (having large area) is in contact with the cushion. Here, his weight falls on a much larger area of the cushion producing much smaller pressure and very little depression in the cushion.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow ;"><strong>Question 44:</strong></span><br />
Use your ideas about pressure to explain why it is easier to walk on soft sand if you have flat shoes rather than shoes with sharp heels.<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Flat shoes have greater area in contact with the soft sand as compared to heels. Due to this, there is less pressure on soft sand because of which they do not sink much in the sand and it is easy to walk on it.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow ;"><strong>Question 45:<br />
</strong></span>Explain why, a nail has a pointed tip.<br />

<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
A nail has a pointed tip, so that when it is hammered, the force of hammer is transferred to a very small area of wood creating a large pressure which pushes the nail into the wood.</p>

<p><span style="color: yellow ;"><strong>Question 46:</strong></span><br />
Explain why, buildings and dams have wide foundations.<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
The foundations of buildings and dams are laid on a large area of ground so that the weight of the building or dam produces less pressure on the ground and they may not sink into the ground.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow ;"><strong>Question 47:</strong></span><br />
Why does a ship made of iron and steel float in water whereas a small piece of iron sinks in it ?<br />
<img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4295/36239162945_1d12d95528_o.jpg" alt="lakhmir-singh-physics-class-9-solutions-chapter-3-gravitation-6" width="296" height="224" /><br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
A ship made of iron and steel is a hollow object which contains a lot of air in it. Due to the presence of a lot of air in it, the average density of the ship becomes less than the density of water. Hence a ship floats in water.<br />
On the other hand, a piece of iron is denser than water, so it sinks in water.</p>

(c) When a boat is partially immersed in water, it displaces 600 kg of water. How much is the buoyant force acting on the boat in newtons ? (g = 10 m s<sup>-2</sup>)<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) The upward force acting on an object immersed in a liquid is called buoyant force.<br />
Factors affecting buoyant force:<br />
(i) Volume of object immersed in the liquid,<br />
(ii) Density of the liquid.<br />
(b) The cause of buoyant force is the greater upward pressure exerted by water underneath the object..<br />
(c) Mass of water displaced = 600kg<br />
Weight of water displaced, W =m x g<br />
=600 x 10 =6000N<br />
Since, the weight of water displaced by the boat is 6000N, therefore the buoyant force acting on the boat will also be 6000N.</p>

<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) According to the principle of floatation: An object will float in a liquid if the weight of object is equal to the weight of liquid displaced by it.<br />
Weight of object = Weight of liquid displaced by it.<br />
(b) Weight of water displaced by boat= 6000N<br />
(i) Buoyant force =6000N, as the weight of water displaced is equal to buoyant force.<br />

(a) What are fluids ? Name two common fluids.<br />
(b) State Archimedes&#8217; principle.<br />
(c) When does an object float or sink when placed on the surface of a liquid ?<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) Those substances which can flow easily are called fluids. All the liquid and gases are fluids, like water, air etc.<br />
(b) Archimedes&#8217; Principle :<br />
When an object is wholly (or partially) immersed in a liquid, it experiences a buoyant force (or upthrust) which is equal to the weight of liquid displaced by the object.<br />
Buoyant force on an object = weight of liquid displaced by that object<br />
(c) If the buoyant force exerted by the liquid is less than the weight of the object, the object will sink in the liquid. If the buoyant force exerted by the liquid is equal to or greater than the weight of the object, the object will float in the liquid.</p>

(d) Which of the two exerts larger pressure on the ground : elephant or girl ?<br />
(e) What is the ratio of pressure exerted by the girl to the pressure exerted by the elephant ?<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Weight of elephant=40000N<br />
Area of one foot =1000 cm<sup>2</sup>= 1000 x 10<sup>-4</sup>m<sup>2</sup><br />
Weight of girl=400N<br />
Area of heel of girl =1 cm<sup>2</sup>=1 x 10<sup>-4</sup>m<sup>2</sup><br />
(a) Elephant has a larger weight of 40000N, therefore, elephant exerts a larger force on the ground. Elephant exerts a larger force on the ground by 40000N &#8211; 400 N=39600N.<br />
(b)Weight of elephant = 40000N<br />

<p><span style="color: yellow ;"><strong>Question 72:<br />
</strong></span>If two equal weights of unequal volumes are balanced in air, what will happen when they are completely dipped in water ? Why ?<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
The two equal weights of unequal volumes which are balanced in air, will get imbalanced when they are completely dipped in water because due to their unequal volumes, they will displace unequal volumes of water and hence suffer unequal loss in weight.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow ;"><strong>Question 73:<br />
</strong></span>Two different bodies are completely immersed in water and undergo the same loss in weight. Is it necessary that their weights in air should also be the same ? Explain.<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
No, it is not necessary that their weights in air should also be the same. This is because the two bodies have undergone the same loss in weight on completely immersing in water due to their equal volumes and not because of their equal weights, so they may have different weights in air.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow ;"><strong>Question 74:<br />
</strong></span>A body floats in kerosene of density 0.8 x 10<sup>3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> up to a certain mark. If the same body is placed in water of density 1.0 x 10<sup>3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup>, will it sink more or less ? Give reason for your solution.<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
The body will sink less in water. This is because the density of water is more than that of kerosene due to which water will exert a greater upward buoyant force on the body.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow ;"><strong>Question 75:<br />
</strong></span>Giving reasons state the reading on a spring balance when it is attached to a floating block of wood which weighs 50 g in air.<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
The reading on spring balance will be zero. This is because the weight of floating block of wood is fully supported by the liquid in which it is floating and hence it does not exert any force on the spring balance.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow ;"><strong>Question 76:<br />
</strong></span>If a fresh egg is put into a beaker filled with water, it sinks. On dissolving a lot of salt in the water, the egg begins to rise and then floats. Why ?<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
When a lot of salt is dissolved in water, then the density of salt solution becomes much more than pure water. Due to its much higher density, the salt solution exerts a greater upward buoyant force on the egg making it rise and then float.</p>

(b) if a piece of heavy metal is placed in it ?<br />
Give reasons for your solution.<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
The reading of spring balance will not change if a cork is placed in water because cork, being lighter than water, floats in water.<br />
(b)The reading of spring balance will change if a piece of heavy metal is placed in<br />
water because heavy metal being denser than water, sinks in water.</p>

</ul>
<p><span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a) The boat sinks a little more in water, that is, the boat floats lower in water.<br />

</strong></span>A y kg sheet of tin sinks in water but if the same sheet is converted into a box or boat, it floats. Why ?<br />
<span style="color: #brown;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
The sheet of tin sinks in water because the density of tin is higher than that of water. When the same sheet of tin is converted into a box or a boat, then due to the trapping of lot of &#8216;light&#8217; air in the box or boat, the average density of the box or boat made of tin sheet becomes lower than that of water and hence it floats in water.</p>

<strong><span style="color: #00bdeb;">CBSE Class 9 Chapter 4 Diversity In Living Organisms</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 1</span><br />
(a) Point Diversity &#8211; This is a diversity present on the smallest scale.<br />
(b) Alpha Diversity &#8211; Also known as local diversity and includes variety of organisms local to a particular habitat.<br />
(c) Gamma Diversity &#8211; It represents the diversity of a larger unit such as an island or a landscape.<br />
(d) Epsilon Diversity &#8211; It is also called regional diversity and includes total diversity of a group of gamma diversity areas.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 2</span><br />
A single plant may be considered as a unit of alpha diversity; a leaf as an area of point diversity; a group of plants occurring together as an area of gamma diversity and the forest within which the plants are located as an area of epsilon diversity.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 3</span><br />
Classification is essential to understand the inter-relationship among different groups of organisms.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 4</span><br />
The basis of classification is to study the diversity among living organisms in an effective way.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 5</span><br />
There are two broad categories of cell structure: Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic. Thus, two broad groups can be formed &#8211; one having prokaryotic cell structure and the other having eukaryotic cell structure.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 6</span><br />
Seven categories of hierarchical classification are: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus and Species.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 7</span><br />
Features of plants:<br />
(a) The growth of plant body is often unlimited and continues till death.<br />
(b) The asexual reproduction or vegetative reproduction is common in the plants.<br />
Features of animals:<br />
(a) They have definite shape and size.<br />
(b) Animals have distinct excretory organs.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 8</span><br />
The two kingdom system of classification was not found to be suitable to many scientists due to large diversity among the organisms and many other limitations. The main demerits of the system are &#8211;<br />
(i) Many protozoans possess characters of both plants and animals. For example, Euglena has animal characters but it contains chlorophyll.<br />
(ii) Bacteria and Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) have many similarities between them and are quite different from other organisms. Thus, it is difficult to place them in their plant or animal kingdom.<br />

Protochordata is one of the groups of phylum chordata. Protochordata constitutes the marine, small, primitive, or lower chordates. The members of protochordates lack a head, skull or cranium, vertebral column and brain. About 2000 species are found in this group. This is further divided into three subphylum: Hemichordata (e.g. Balanoglossus ), Urochordata (e.g. Herdmania) and Cephalochordata (e.g. Branchiostoma) based on the position of notochord.<br />

Notochord is a transient mesodermal rod in the most dorsal portion of the chordate embryo. In other words, notochord is an ensheathed flexible rod of turgid cells located along the back of chordate embryos and some primitive chordates ventral to nerve cord. It provides place for the attachment of muscles. Notochord has given rise to jointed axial skeleton of vertebral column.<br />
Nerve cord is a collection of nerve fibres that runs throughout the length of an animal. It is hollow and dorsal in chordates where it gets modified into central nervous system of brain and spinal cord. Nerve cord is solid and ventral in nonchordates.<br />

The Linnaean system of classification consists of a hierarchy of graded taxonomic (named) ranks that are called as taxa. Any given taxon (singular) may contain several lower taxa, which can be usually distinguished based on certain common characteristics. Such lower ranks may in turn be divided into a succession of progressively smaller ranks. The lower the rank of a group, the more similar are the organisms grouped in it. If any two given organisms can be grouped under the same lower rank or taxon, it implies that the two organisms are structurally, functionally, embryologically similar and that they have had a comparable evolutionary history.<br />
Within the living world as a whole, the biggest taxonomic rank is Kingdom. The next higher rank within a kingdom is the Phylum or Division. It is customary to use the term phylum for major groups in the animal kingdom and the term division for major groups in the plant kingdom. The phylum or division is a broad grouping of more or less closely related organisms, sharing certain common characteristics.<br />
Each phylum or division has the next taxon called Class. The members of each class exhibit certain distinguishing characters that are unique only to them.<br />
In the same way, using comparable criteria of similarities and relationships, each class can be divided into orders, each order into families, each family into genera and each genus into species. Species is normally the basic or fundamental unit of classification. A species is therefore the narrowest taxonomic category and kingdom is the broadest category in the Linnaean hierarchy.<br />
A typical Linnaean hierarchy has seven taxa represented as follows:<br />

(ii) It projects before us a good picture of all life forms at a glance.<br />
(iii) It helps us understand the interrelationship among different groups of organisms.<br />
(iv) It serves as a base for the development of other biological sciences such as biogeography etc.<br />
(v) Various fields of applied biology such as agriculture, public health and environmental biology depends on classification of pests, disease vectors, pathogens and components of an ecosystem.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 3</span><br />
Hierarchy is defined as sequence of categories in a decreasing or increasing order from kingdom to species and vice versa. Kingdom is the highest rank followed by division, class, order, family, genus and species. Species is the lowest rank in the hierarchy. The hierarchy has two categories which are obligate and intermediate. Obligate means they are followed strictly and range from kingdom to species as said above. Intermediate are not followed strictly and they are added in obligate list such as subdivision, super family, super class, suborder, subspecies etc.;<br />
(i) Species: Group of population which is similar in form, shape and reproductive features so that fertile sibling can be produced. Some siblings can be sterile when a hybrid is produced. A hybrid can be product of female horse and male donkey (Mule). Sexual reproduction is present in eukaryotes. Species is followed by subspecies, varieties and races. These categories are inferior as compared to species.<br />
(ii) Genus: It is defined as group of similar species. But it is not mandatory to have many species. Some genera have only one species known as monotypic. If there are more than one species it is known as polytypic. For example lion, tiger are quite similar species placed under the genus Panthera.<br />
(iii) Family: It is defined as collection of similar genera. It can be separated from genera by reproductive and vegetative features. For example, cats and leopard are included in the family Felidae.<br />
(iv) Order: One or more than one similar families constitute order. Family Felidae are included in the order Carnivora.<br />
(v) Class: One or more than one order makes a class. Class Mammalia includes all mammals which are bats, rodents, kangaroos, whales, great apes and man.<br />
(vi) Phylum: It is a term used for animals while its synonym division is used for plants. It is a collection of similar classes. Phylum chordata of animals has class Mammalia along with birds, reptiles and amphibians.<br />
(vii) Kingdom: The top most taxonomic category. Example all animals are included in Kingdom Animalia. The unit in classification that denotes grouping of organism based on features which are observable is known as Taxon.<br />

Kingdom Monera is the first of the five kingdoms of biological classification. It comprised most organisms with a prokaryotic cell organization. For this reason the kingdom was sometimes called Prokaryota or Prokaryotae. Prior to its creation these were treated as two separate divisions of plants: the Schizomycetes (bacteria) were considered fungi, and the Cyanophyta were considered blue-green algae. The latter are now considered a group of bacteria, typically called the cyanobacteria.<br />
Monera has been divided into Archaea and Bacteria, forming the more recent six-kingdom system and three-domain system. All new schemes abandon the Monera and now treat the Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya as separate domains or kingdoms. To sum up:<br />
(i) Kingdom Monera are one-celled without an organized nucleus. Examples: bacteria and blue-green &#8220;algae.&#8221;<br />
(ii) They have existed on earth longer and are more widely distributed than any other organisms.<br />
(iii) They are found in almost every imaginable habitat; in air, soil, and water and in extreme temperatures and harsh chemical environments.<br />
(iv) Their one distinguishing characteristic is that there are no membrane bound &#8220;organelles&#8221;.<br />
(v) Pre dominant mode of nutrition is absorption but some may be photosynthetic or chemosynthetic.<br />

(iv) Many are unicellular, but some are multicellular (Algae and fungus-like protists).<br />
(v) Some can live in very harsh environments.<br />
(vi) Reproduction can be sexual (conjugation), asexual (binary fission), or a combination of both.<br />
(vii)Some of these organisms use appendages, such as hair-like cilia (e.g. Paramecium) or whip-like flagellum (e.g. Euglena).<br />

Some fungi, such as Puccinia, Albugo etc are parasites and draw their nutrients from living cells of their host plants. Some fungi, such as Mucor, Rhizopus etc are decomposers, deriving their nutrition from dead remains of plants and animals.<br />
(ii) They may be unicellular (yeast) or filamentous (most fungi). The body of a multicellular and filamentous fungus is called a mycelium and is composed of several thread like structures termed hyphae.<br />
(iii) Fungi have a cell wall containing a mixture of chitin and cellulose. Chitin is a tough complex sugar.<br />
(iv) Their reserve food material is glycogen.<br />

The division Spermatophyta (sperma = seed, phyton = plant), as the name suggests, includes all seed bearing plants. It has been divided into two sub divisions- Gymnosperms and Angiosperms. The sub-division Gymnosperms (gymno = naked, sperma = seed) includes simpler and primitive plants of the division Spermatophyta.<br />
Gymnosperms: The gymnosperms are seed producing land plants. However, the seeds are not enclosed in fruits. Most of them have now become extinct and only about 900 species are known to be surviving. The living gymnosperms are widely distributed in the cold climates where snow, rather than rain, is the source of water. Only one group called cycads thrive in warmer regions. Example: Pinus.<br />
Angiosperms: Angiosperms represent the most advanced group of vascular plants. They are commonly called &#8216;Flowering plants&#8217;. They exceed all other major groups of living plants in number and diversity.<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 1</span></strong><br />
Mass = m<br />
Height above the ground = h<br />
Work done = Potential energy acquired by the body = m x g x h<br />
where g is acceleration due to gravity<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 2</span></strong><br />
SI unit of work is Joule (J).<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 3</span></strong><br />
Work is a scalar quantity.<br />
Work, as a physical quantity, requires only magnitude to be represented. Hence, it is scalar quantity.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 4</span></strong><br />
When a force of 1 newton moves a body through a distance of 1 metre in its own direction, then the work done is known as 1 joule.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 5</span></strong><br />
The condition for a force to do work on a body is that it should produce motion in the body.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 6</span></strong><br />
Energy is a scalar quantity. It has only magnitude but no direction.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 7</span></strong><br />
a)Unit of work is joule.<br />
b) Unit of energy is joule.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 8</span></strong><br />
The work done against gravity is zero when a body is moved horizontally along a frictionless surface because force of gravity acts perpendicular to the direction of motion.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 9</span></strong><br />
Kinetic energy will become four times when the speed is doubled because kinetic<br />
energy is directly proportional to square of speed of the body<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 11</span></strong><br />
Kinetic<br />
energy will become one-fourth when the speed is halved because kinetic energy<br />
is directly proportional to square of speed of the body<br />

a) Both kinetic and potential energy<br />
b) Both kinetic and potential energy<br />
c) Only kinetic energy<br />
d) Only potential energy<br />
e) Only potential energy<br />
Note: In all the above cases we take ground as reference level where potential energy is zero.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 16</span></strong><br />
Let masses of body A and B be m<br />
Height of body A = h<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 18</span></strong><br />
Potential energy is a scalar quantity as it has magnitude only and it does not require any specification of direction.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 19</span></strong><br />
Mass = 100 kg<br />
Height = 5 m<br />
g = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup><br />
P.E. = m x g x h = 100 x 5 x 9.8 = 4900 J<br />
Work done is equal to PE acquired by the body.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 20</span></strong><br />
False.<br />
PE = m x g x h<br />
= 1 x 9.8 x 1 = 9.8 J<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 21</span></strong><br />
The potential energy is doubled when the height is doubled since potential energy is directly proportional to height, h to which body is raised.<br />

a) Force ; distance<br />
b) Zero<br />
c) newton; metre; force<br />
d) Energy; kinetic energy<br />
e) mechanical<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 24</span></strong><br />
The work done by a force on a body depends on two factors<br />
a) magnitude of force<br />
b) distance through which the body moves<br />
Work done is directly proportional to the force applied and the distance through which the body moves.<br />
W = F x s<br />
where W is work done, F is force applied and s is distance through which the body moves.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 25</span></strong><br />
Yes, it is possible that a force is acting on a body but still work done is zero. For example, in the case of a man pushing a wall, the work done is zero despite of non-zero force, sin ce there is no displacement of the wall.</p>
<p><span style="color: #00bdeb;">Page 146</span><br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 26</span></strong><br />
a) Work done by force applied by the boy is positive because this force is in the direction of motion of the body.<br />
b) Work done by the gravitational force is negative because this force is against the direction of motion of the body.<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 31</span></strong><br />
a)The change of one form of energy into another form of energy is known as transformation of energy, e.g. in a cell chemical energy is transformed into<br />
electrical energy<br />
b) a. When a ball is thrown upwards its kinetic energy gradually converts into potential energy and potential energy<br />
becomes maximum at the maximum height attained by the ball<br />
b. When a stone is dropped from the roof of the building its potential energy gradually converts into kinetic energy and kinetic energy becomes maximum when the stone is just above the ground<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 32</span></strong><br />
a) Law of conservation of energy states that whenever energy changes from one form to another form, the total amount of energy remains constant. Energy can<br />
never be created nor destroyed, it transforms from one form to another. For example, when electrical energy is converted into light energy in an electric<br />
bulb, then some energy is wasted as heat during conversion but the total energy remains the same.<br />
b) Initially the pendulum is at rest. The bob is pulled to one side to position B to give it potential energy due to higher position of B and then released, the bob<br />
starts swinging<br />
i. When the bob is at position B, it has potential energy but no kinetic energy<br />
ii. As the bob starts moving down from position B to A, its potential energy starts decreasing and kinetic energy starts increasing<br />
iii. When the bob is at position A, it has maximum kinetic energy and zero potential energy<br />
iv. As the bob starts moving down from position A to C, its kinetic energy starts decreasing and potential energy starts increasing<br />
v. On reaching the extreme position C, the bob stops for a very small instant of time and bob maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy.<br />
Therefore at extreme positions B and C bob has only potential energy and at A it has only kinetic energy and at other intermediate positions bob has both kinetic<br />
and potential energy. Thus the total energy of the pendulum is same for any instant of time (conserved)<br />

<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 8</span><br />
A vector is a carrier (mosquito, tick) that takes the disease from an infected individual to an uninfected individual. They do not have the disease themselves; they carry the infected agent such as blood. A reservoir is anything (person, animal, arthropod, plant, soil or substance) in which a disease lives and can multiply. The disease needs the reservoir in order to survive. A vector must be living but a reservoir can be a living or a non living thing such as soil or water. Vectors or carriers are not pathogenic but are simply transmitters.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 9</span><br />
Organ Specific Manifestation- These are the diseases caused in the same organ or organ system as the point of entry of the microbe. E.g. Tuberculosis which enters through the nose and affects the lungs. (Both are organs of the respiratory system)<br />
Tissue Specific Manifestation- These are the diseases caused in a different organ as the point of entry. E.g. Japanese Encephalitis which enters through the blood but affects the brain.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 10</span><br />
There are many possible areas, organs and tissues within our body where microbes may reside. However the severity of disease symptoms depends on the number of microbes in the body. For example, if the number of microbes is very small, then the symptoms of disease will be minor or unnoticed. However, if the numbers are large, the disease can be severe enough to be life-risking.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 11</span><br />
Infection of HIV is found to have multiple dimensional effects. In case of HIV infection, the virus goes to immune system and ultimately damages its function. Thus many symptoms of HIV &#8211; AIDS infection are due to the fact that patients body no longer fight off many minor infections that he/she faces everyday.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 12</span><br />
There are two ways to treat an infectious disease. One is to reduce the effects of the disease and the other way is to kill the cause of the disease.<br />
For example, we can take the medicines that bring down the fever, reduce pain or loose motions. We can take bed rest so that we can converse our energy. This exercise will enable us to focus on the healing. However it will not make the pathogen to go away, so the disease will not be cured. For that we have to kill the microbe.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 13</span><br />
Prevention is better than cure as a disease always cause some damage to the body, loss of working days, besides expenditure on medication. The important precautions for preventing occurrence of diseases include (i) hygienic environment; (ii) personal hygiene; (iii) proper nutrition; (iv) clean food; (v) clean water; (vi) regular exercise and (vii) adequate relaxation. Everybody should also be aware of diseases and their mode of spreading (epidemic). A regular medical checkup is also earnestly required to stay healthy.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 14</span><br />
Vaccines help a body&#8217;s immune system prepare in advance to fight infectious illnesses and potentially deadly diseases caused by infectious agents or their by-products. Vaccines work on the principle of immunization. During vaccination, when the immune system first encounters an infectious microbe, it responds against it and then remembers it specifically. So the next time that particular microbe, or its close relatives enter the body, the immune system responds with greater vigour. This eliminates the infection even more quickly than the first occurrence of the disease.<br />

The diarrhoea spreads through infection by contaminated food, water, drinks, hands, clothes etc. During diarrhoea frequent loose motions and vomiting leads to dehydration.<br />
To control the dehydration during diarrhoea; Saline drip may be given intravenously to maintain fluid and electrolytes in the body. Alternatively oral rehydration Solution (ORS) may be given to the patient periodically.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 17</span><br />
Stagnant water (of pools, ponds) in the locality is the habitat of larvae of many types of mosquitoes and they are the vector of a disease, called malaria.<br />
Doctor confirms malaria if the patients have following symptoms: headache, nausea, muscular pain and high fever. Doctor also checks the presence of malarial parasite in the human body by blood test.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 18</span><br />
Methods of prevention of Malaria:<br />
(i) Wire-gauze should be used on doors and windows of houses to prevent entry of mosquitoes.<br />
(ii) One should sleep under mosquito nets.<br />
(iii) Insect-repellents should be used to prevent mosquito-bite.<br />
(iv) Mosquito larvae can be killed by sprinkling kerosene oil on large-sized water bodies.<br />

The person having AIDS lose the power of fighting any infection. The disease of AIDS is caused by retrovirus (a RNA virus) known as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).<br />
AIDS disease spreads among human beings in the following ways:<br />
(i) The AIDS usually spreads through unprotected sexual contacts with an infected person carrying AIDS virus.<br />
(ii) It also spreads through the transfusion of blood contaminated with an AIDS virus.<br />
(iii) It also spreads through the use of infected needles for injections.<br />
(iv) An AIDS infected mother can transmit the virus to her child during pregnancy or during birth.<br />

Diarrhoea is an abnormally frequent discharge of semisolid or fluid faeces. It spreads through infection by contaminated food, water, drinks, hands, clothes, bed sheets and utensils.<br />
Symptoms of Diarrhoea:<br />
(i) Decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps.<br />
(ii) There may be blood and mucus in the stools.<br />
Prevention:<br />
(i) Eatables should be covered to prevent their contamination.<br />
(ii) Fruits and vegetable should be properly washed before use.<br />
(iii) Stale food should not be consumed.<br />
Control:<br />
(i) Complete bed rest should be ensured till the illness is fully controlled.<br />
(ii) For treating diarrhoea anti-microbial drugs and anti-diarrhoea agents should be used.<br />

Pulse Polio Programme &#8211; Pulse polio immunization programme forms the largest single day public health project. Pulse means a dose of a substance (here polio vaccine) especially when applied for a short period of time. It was conducted for the first time in 1995. The program uses oral polio vaccine or OPV. As per the National Immunization Schedule (NIS), a dose of 3 drops is given orally to the child, i.e. one dose each at 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 month&#8217;s age. Finally a booster dose is given at the age of 1.5 years. After oral administration, virus particles in the vaccine begin to live in the intestine of the human body and multiply. It leads to production of protective molecules in the intestine and the blood.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 1</span><br />
Human beings live in societies. Our social environment therefore plays an important role in our individual health. In villages, towns or cities, our physical environment is decided by our social environment. For example &#8211; if there are heaps of garbage and trash littered here and there, or if there is open drain water lying stagnant around where we live, the possibility of poor health increases. So, public cleanliness is an important contribution to an individual&#8217;s health.<br />
Some other community issues that influence health are:<br />
Community issues like child marriage can affect the health of the girl the baby born to an underage girl.<br />
Lack of education of the community to sex related issues can also cause sexually transmitted diseases.<br />
Bad treatment with the underprivileged sections of the society can also cause mental problems.<br />
Social equality and harmonious relationships among our population are necessary for the individual health. Thus, we see that there is an overlap of personal and community issues for health.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 2</span><br />
Infectious diseases spread from one infected person to other normal person by various methods.<br />
(a) Air-borne diseases &#8211; For example: common cold, pneumonia and tuberculosis. Such disease causing microbes are spread throughout the air. The transmission of these microbes occurs through the little droplets coughed out by an infected person who sneezes or coughs. A person in the vicinity of such a person can inhale these disease causing microbes and may become infected.<br />
(b)Water-borne diseases &#8211; For example: Cholera, Infectious diseases can also spread through water. These occur when a stool from someone suffering from an infectious gut disease, such as cholera or amoebiasis, gets mixed with the drinking water used by people living nearby. The cholera-infested bacteria can enter new hosts through the water they drink and can cause disease in them.<br />
(c) Sexually-transmitted diseases &#8211; For example: Syphilis and AIDS. Both of these pathogens are transmitted by sexual contact from one partner to the other. However, such sexually transmitted diseases are not spread by casual physical contact.<br />
(e) Formite borne diseases &#8211; Articles coming in contact with the patients act as sources of infection. For example: door handles, taps, garments, utensils, crockery, etc.<br />
(f) Spread of disease through vectors &#8211; Many animals which live with us may carry diseases. These animals can transfer infecting agents from a sick person to another potential host. Thus, these animals act as intermediaries or vectors. For example &#8211; female Anopheles mosquitos are vectors of disease, malaria.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 3</span><br />
General ways of preventing infection are:<br />
Public hygiene is one basic key to the prevention of infectious diseases.<br />
In the method of prevention of diseases, following practices are adopted:<br />
(i) To avoid exposure to air-borne microbes, adopt living conditions that are not overcrowded.<br />
(ii) To prevent exposure to water-borne microbes, safe drinking water should be provided.<br />
(iii) To avoid vector-borne infections, we can provide clean environment as it would not allow mosquito breeding.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 4</span><br />
Principle of Treatment:<br />
There are two ways to treat an infectious disease. One is to reduce the effects of the disease and the other way is to kill the cause of the disease. For the first requirement, we can provide treatments that will reduce the symptoms. The symptoms are usually a result of inflammation. For example, we can take medicines that bring down fever, reduce pain or loose motions. We can take bed rest so that we can converse our energy.<br />
However such a kind of symptom-directed treatment by itself is inadequate. Since it will not make the pathogen go away, so the disease will not be cured. For that we have to kill the microbe itself.<br />

(a) AIDS &#8211; AIDS stands for Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome. It is a fatal disease. The disease of AIDS is caused by retrovirus (a RNA virus) known as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). AIDS virus attacks white blood cells (WBCs) or lymphocytes of human beings and weakens the human body&#8217;s immunity or self-defence mechanism.<br />
Some important symptoms of AIDS are: Swollen lymph nodes, regular fever, sweating at night and weight loss. Its virus also cause severe damage to brain and may lead to loss of memory, ability to speak and of clear thinking.<br />
(b) Malaria &#8211; Malaria is caused by a protozoan parasite Plasmodium. This disease spreads through the bite of an insect vector &#8211; the female Anopheles mosquito which feeds on human blood. Male Anopheles mosquito feeds upon plant juice. Main symptoms of malaria include headache, nausea, muscular pain and high fever. Malarial attack consists of three stages:<br />
(i) Cold stage, feeling of extreme cold and shivers.<br />
(ii) Hot stage, high fever, faster respiration and heart beat.<br />
(iii) Sweating stage, due to profuse sweating, temperature of the body goes down to normal.<br />

Few diseases caused by bacteria are:<br />
(i) Tuberculosis (T.B.) &#8211; T.B. is an infectious disease which is communicated from one person to another directly or indirectly. It is caused by the bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. T.B. can affect all parts of the body such as lungs, lymph glands, bones, intestine etc.<br />
(ii) Cholera &#8211; Cholera is an acutely infectious, fatal disease and is more common during overcrowded fairs, festivals and after floods. Cholera is caused by the bacterium Vibrio Cholerae. It is transmitted by flies, contaminated water and food.<br />
(iii) Typhoid &#8211; Typhoid is most common communicable disease in India. Typhoid fever is common in humans of the age 1to 15 years age group. Typhoid is caused by a rod-shaped and motile bacterium, called Salmonella typhi which is commonly found in the intestine of human beings. Human infection is direct.<br />
(iv) Diarrhoea &#8211; Diarrhoea is an abnormally frequent discharge of semisolid or fluid faeces. The diarrhoea spreads through infection by contaminated food, water, drinks, hands, clothes, etc. The causative agents of diarrhoea are mainly bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Clostridium botulinum, Shigella dysentiriae, Campylobacter jejuri and Salmonella.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 7</span><br />
Important viral diseases of human beings are:<br />
(i) Influenza &#8211; Influenza is commonly called flu. It is caused by an influenza virus (Myxovirus influenza). There exist three types of influenza viruses &#8211; A, B and C. A and B types of influenza viruses are important because these are responsible for causing of disease epidemics throughout the world. The inhaled virus attacks the epithelial cells in the mucous membrane of nose, throat and upper respiratory tract. Influenza is spread mainly from person to person contact and by droplet infection via sneezing, coughing and talking.<br />
(ii) Jaundice &#8211; Jaundice or hepatitis is the disease of liver. Since liver is a very important organ in the body, so its inflammation due to jaundice affects digestion adversely. Jaundice is caused by viral infection. The types of hepatitis are: Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Hepatitis D, Hepatitis E or Hepatitis G. Except for type B which is a DNA virus, all the other are RNA viruses. Hepatitis is spread mostly by food and water contaminated with hepatitis virus.<br />
(iii) AIDS &#8211; AIDS stands for Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome. It is a fatal disease. The disease of AIDS is caused by retrovirus (a RNA virus) known as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). AIDS virus attacks white blood cells (WBCs) or lymphocytes of human beings and weakens the human body&#8217;s immunity or self-defence mechanism. AIDS becomes prone to many other infections or diseases.<br />
(iv) Polio &#8211; Poliomyelitis or polio is a disease of the nervous system caused by one of the smallest known virus, called polio virus. The virus enters the body through the food and water and reaches the intestine and from there it enters the CNS or central nervous system via blood stream and lymphatic systems. Children between the age of 6 months to 3 years are most prone to polio infection. Polio is transmitted among children by the faeco-oral route and through the direct contact, dirty hands, contaminated food or milk and flies.<br />

(a) Tuberculosis &#8211; T.B. is an infectious disease which is communicated from one person to another directly or indirectly. It is caused by the bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. T.B. can affect all parts of the body such as lungs, lymph glands, bones, intestine etc. The incubation period of T.B. includes a few weeks to a few years.<br />
The patient of tuberculosis feels sick and weak. There is a loss of appetite and weight. Typical fever pattern and night sweats are also common.<br />
(b) Polio &#8211; Poliomyelitis or polio is a disease of the nervous system caused by one of the smallest known virus, called polio virus. The virus enters the body through the food and water and reaches the intestine and from there it enters the CNS or central nervous system via blood stream and lymphatic systems. Children between the age of 6 months to 3 years are most prone to polio infection. Polio is transmitted among children by the faeco-oral route and through the direct contact, dirty hands, contaminated food or milk and flies.<br />
The early symptoms of the polio disease are sore throat and headache.</p>

to the direction in which the wave is moving, is called a transverse wave. It can be produced in solids and liquids but not in gases.<br />
(b) Sound is a longitudinal wave.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 44</span></strong><br />
Due to the very high speed of light we see the ball hitting the bat first. And it is due to comparatively lower speed of sound that the sound of hitting is heard a little later.<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 51</span></strong><br />
In most of the cases, a sound producing object vibrates so fast that we cannot see its vibrations with our eyes. The time inetrval between two successive vibration is lower than the persistence of vision. Hence we see the object in static state and not in vibration mode.<br />

<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 60</span></strong><br />
(a) Sound is that form of energy which makes us hear. Sound waves are longitudinal waves in air.<br />
(b) Sound cannot travel through vacuum. This can be shown by the following experiment:<br />
(i) A ringing electric bell is placed inside an air tight glass jar containing air. We can hear the sound of ringing bell clearly. Thus, when air is present as medium in the bell jar, sound can travel through it and reach our ears.<br />
(ii) The bell jar containing ringing bell is placed over the plate of a vacuum pump. Air is gradually removed from the bell jar by switching on the vacuum pump. As more and more air is removed from the bell jar, the sound of ringing bell becomes fainter and fainter. And when all the air is removed from the bell jar, no sound can be heard at all. Thus, when vacuum is created in the bell jar, then the sound of ringing bell placed inside it cannot be heard.<br />
This shows that sound cannot travel through vacuum.<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 61</span></strong><br />
(a) Sound is produced when an object vibrates. For example, the sound of our voice is produced by the vibrations of two vocal cords in our throat caused by air coming from the lungs.<br />
(b) When an object vibrates (and makes sound), then the air layers around it also start vibrating in exactly the same way and carry sound waves from the sound producing object to our ears.<br />
Suppose a tuning fork is vibrating and producing sound waves in air. Since the prongs of the tuning fork are vibrating, the individual layers of air are also vibrating. Sound travels in the form of longitudinal waves in which the back and forth vibrations of the air layers are in the same direction as the movement of sound wave.<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 62</span></strong><br />
(a) If the air is gradually pumped out of the glass vessel, no sound of the electric bell can be heard because vacuum is created in the vessel and there are no air molecules to carry sound vibrations.<br />
(b) Sound cannot be heard on the surface of moon because there is no air on the moon to carry the sound waves.<br />
Astronauts talk to one another on the surface of moon through wireless sets using radio waves. This is because radio waves can travel even through vacuum though sound waves cannot travel through vacuum.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 63</span></strong><br />

Velocity of wave= frequency x wavelength<br />

(a) The &#8216;elevation&#8217; or &#8216;hump&#8217; in a transverse wave is called crest. It is that part of the transverse wave which is above the line of zero disturbance of the medium. The &#8216;depression&#8217; or &#8216;hollow&#8217; in a transverse wave is called trough. It is that part of the transverse wave which is below the line of zero disturbance of medium. A ransverse wave consists of crests and troughs.<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 67</span></strong><br />
(a) When we put our ear to a railway line, we can hear the sound of an approaching train even when the train is far off but its sound cannot be heard through the air. This is due to the fact that sound travels much more fast through the railway line made of steel than through air.<br />
(b) There is no actual movement of air from the sound-producing body to our ear. The air layers only vibrate back and forth, and transfer the sound energy from one layer to the next layer till it reaches our ear.<br />
This will be clear from an example: If we turn on a gas tap for a few seconds, a person standing a few metres away will hear the sound of escaping gas first and the smell of gas reaches him afterwards. The sound of gas travels through the vibrations of air layers so it reaches first, but the smell of gas reaches the person through the actual movement of the air layers, which takes more time. So, it is clear that the sound is not being transmitted by the actual movement of air from the gas tap to person, otherwise he would hear and smell the gas at the same time.</p>

An echo is heard sooner on a hot day because the speed of sound in air increases with temperature. So the speed of sound in air is more on a hot day, and an echo is heard sooner.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 39</span></strong><br />
An echo is heard sooner in water because the speed of sound in water is higher than the speed of sound in air.<br />

The persistence of sound in a big hall due to repeated reflections from the walls, ceiling and floor of the hall is called reverberation. If the reverberation time in a big hall is too long, then the sound becomes blurred, distorted and confusing due to overlapping.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 41</span></strong><br />
Reverberations in a big hall or auditorium can be reduced by the following methods :<br />
i) Panels made of sound absorbing materials are put on the walls and ceilings of hall and auditorium.<br />
ii) Carpets are put on the floor to absorb sound and reduce reverberations<br />
iii) Heavy curtains are put on doors and windows to absorb sound and reduce reverberations<br />
iv) The seats in the hall are made from materials having sound absorbing properties<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 42</span></strong><br />
We hear more clearly in a room with curtains than in a room without curtains because curtains are bad reflectors of sound. They absorb most of the sound falling on them, and hence do not produce echoes. On the other hand, in rooms without curtains, there is a greater reflection of sound due to which some echoes are produced.<br />
These echoes cause a hindrance to hearing.<br />

The soundboard is a concave board (curved board) which is placed behind the speaker in large halls or auditoriums so that his speech can be easily heard even by the persons sitting at a considerable distance. The sound board works as follows: the speaker is made to stand at the focus of the concave soundboard. The concave surface of the soundboard reflects the sound waves of the speaker towards the audience (and hence prevents the spreading of sound in various directions). Due to this, sound is distributed uniformly throughout the hall and even the persons sitting at the back of the hall can hear the speech easily.<br />

Quality (or timbre) is that characteristic of the sound by which we can distinguish between sounds of same pitch and loudness produced by different musical instruments (and different singers). The quality (or timbre) depends on the shape of the sound wave (or waveform) produced by it.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 50</span></strong><br />
When we strike a table lightly, then due to less energy supplied, the table top vibrates with a small amplitude and hence a soft sound is produced. However if we hit the table hard, due to greater energy supplied, the table top vibrates with a large amplitude and hence a loud sound is produced.<br />

Ultrasound is used in industry for detecting flaws in metal blocks without damaging them. In hospitals, ultrasound is used to investigate the internal organs of the human body such as liver, kidneys, uterus, etc.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 52</span></strong><br />
Bats are able to fly at night without colliding with other objects because they emit high frequency ultrasonic squeaks while flying and listen to the echoes produced by the reflection of their squeaks from the objects or obstacles in their path. From the time taken by the echo to be heard, bats can judge the distance of the object in their path and avoid it by changing the direction.<br />

Construction of human ear:<br />
The ear consists of three compartments: outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The outer ear consists of broad part called pinna and about 2 to 3 centimeters long passage called ear canal. At the end of ear canal is a thin, elastic, circular membrane called tympanum or ear-drum. The middle ear contains three small delicate bones called hammer, anvil and stirrup. These bones are linked to one another. The one end of hammer is touching the ear drum and its other end is connected to the second bone called anvil. The other end of anvil is connected to the third bone called stirrup. And the free end of stirrup is held against the membrane over the oval window of the inner ear. The lower part of middle ear has Eustachian tube going to the throat. The inner ear has a coiled structure called cochlea. The cochlea is filled with liquid containing sound sensitive nerve cells. The other side of cochlea is connected to the auditory nerve which goes to the brain.<br />
Working of human ear:<br />
The sound waves are collected by the pinna. These sound waves pass through ear canal and fall on the ear-drum. Sound waves consist of compressions and rarefactions. When the compression strikes the ear drum, the pressure on the outside of ear drum increases and pushes the ear drum inwards. And when rarefaction strikes the ear drum, the pressure on the outside of ear drum decreases and it moves outwards. Thus, when sound waves fall on the ear drum, it vibrates back and forth rapidly. These vibrations are passed onto the three bones in the middle ear and finally to the liquid in the cochlea. Due to this, liquid in the cochlea starts to vibrate, setting up electrical impulses in the nerve cells present in it. These impulses are carried to the brain by auditory nerve. The brain interprets the impulses and we get the sensation of hearing.</p>

<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 1</span><br />
Air is composed of a mixture of gases such as nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide. It also contains water vapours and suspended dust particles.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 2</span><br />
Oxygen is required by all living beings for respiration and for burning materials. This is balanced by green plants. Green plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen during the process of photosynthesis.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 3</span><br />
The atmosphere keeps the average temperature of the earth fairly steady during the day as the atmosphere prevents the sudden increase in temperature during the daylight hours and at night atmosphere slows down the escape of heat into the outer space.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 4</span><br />
The movement of air from one region to another creates winds. When the solar radiations fall on the earth, some are absorbed and majority of these are reflected back by the land and water bodies. These reflected solar radiations heat up the atmosphere from below. As a result convection currents are set up in the air but since land gets heated faster than the water, the air above the land gets heated faster than the air over water bodies. During the day the air above the land gets heated and starts rising, creating a region of low pressure below. As a result the air over the sea moves into this region of low pressure and forms the wind.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 5</span><br />
(i) Take a beaker full of water, a beaker full of soil and a closed bottle containing a thermometer.<br />
(ii) Keep them in bright sunlight for three hours.<br />
(iii) Now, measure the temperature of all three vessels and also take the temperature reading in shade at the same time.<br />
(iv) You will observe that the temperature of the soil and sand is more than that of water in bright sunlight because sand and soil gets heated by solar radiations faster than the water.<br />
(v) Therefore, land would become hot faster than the sea.<br />
(vi) You will also observe that the temperature of air in shade is different from the temperature of soil, sand and water in bright sunlight because of the direct effect of radiations.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 6</span><br />
When the solar radiations fall on the earth, some are absorbed and majority of these are reflected back or re-radiated by the land and water bodies. These reflected or re-radiated solar radiations heat the atmosphere from below. As a result convection currents are set up in the air.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 7</span><br />
The factors that influence the movement of air are:<br />
(i) Uneven heating of land at different parts of the earth.<br />
(ii) Differences in heating and cooling of land and water bodies.<br />
(iii) Vapourisation and condensation of water vapours.<br />
(iv) Rotation of earth.<br />
(v) Presence of high mountain ranges in the paths of wind.<br />
(vi) Difference in topography over which the wind passes.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 8</span><br />
When the water bodies get heated by solar radiations during the day, a large amount of water evaporates and goes in the air. The air carrying water vapours also gets heated. This hot air rises up carrying water vapours with it. As the air rises, it expands and cools. This cooling causes the water vapour in the air to condense as tiny droplets which slowly grow bigger by the condensation of more water droplets and forms clouds. When the droplets have grown big and heavy, they fall down in the form of rain.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 9</span><br />
(i) Take an empty plastic bottle.<br />
(ii) Pour 5-10 ml water into it and close the bottle tightly with a cap.<br />
(iii) Shake the bottle well and then place it in the sun for 10 minutes.<br />
(iv) Now, open the cap of the bottle and allow some smoke from the lighted incense stick to enter the bottle.<br />
(v) Quickly close the bottle tightly with the cap.<br />
(vi) Press the bottle hard between your hands as much as possible.<br />
(vii) After few seconds release the bottle. Press the bottle again as hard as you can.<br />
This simple experiment replicates, on a very small scale, the happenings when air with a very high content of water vapour goes from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure. When bottle containing water is kept in the sun, the water evaporates and air inside the bottle gets saturated with water vapour. When the bottle is pressed between your hands, the pressure inside becomes high and air inside the bottle moves in a region of low pressure. It expands and cools. The smoke particles act as &#8216;nuclei&#8217; on which water vapours condense in the form of tiny droplets. When you release the pressure, the air inside the bottle becomes foggy. When bottle is again pressed, the fog will disappear. It is so because due to high pressure condensed water vapours will fall down and collect as water at the bottom of the bottle. When the experiment is repeated without smoke inside the bottle, one will not observe foggy air inside the bottle as smoke particles are absent and nothing is available in air to act as &#8216;nucleus&#8217; for water vapours to condense as tiny droplets.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 10</span><br />
The major components of air pollution are soot, fly ash, dust particles, smoke and some gases like sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, ammonia etc.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 11</span><br />
When fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum products are burnt, they produce oxides of nitrogen and sulphur. On dissolving in rain these oxides form nitric acid and sulphuric acid respectively. This causes acid rain. These acids wash down into the soil and make it highly acidic, thus, affecting the growth of plants and ultimately the forest growth. It also affects the surface of buildings by eroding the stone and brick works.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 12</span><br />
Smog is a photochemical haze caused by the action of solar ultra violet radiation on atmosphere polluted with primary pollutants such as hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen from automobile exhaust. It reduces visibility and is highly suffocating and toxic to humans, animals and plants.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 13</span><br />
Effects of air pollution on human beings:<br />
(i) Suspended particulate matter causes asthma, bronchitis and allergic cold.<br />
(ii) Pollutant gases cause irritation in eyes, throat and lungs. Heart related diseases tend to increase.<br />
(iii) Hydrocarbon vapours not only damage the internal organs but also cause cancer.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 14</span><br />
In coastal areas, during daytime, there is a regular flow of cool air from the sea towards the land. At night, there is a reverse flow of air from land to sea. This happens because during the daytime, land gets heated faster than water.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 15</span><br />
The atmosphere keeps the average temperature of the earth fairly steady during the day as the atmosphere prevents the sudden increase in temperature during the daylight hours and at night atmosphere slows down the escape of heat into the outer space.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 16</span><br />
Atmosphere is divided into five distinct layers: Troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere and exosphere.<br />
i. Troposphere is the lowest region of atmosphere which contains air and is subject of differential heating. It extends from the surface of the earth upto 8-20 kms. Many important climatic events such as cloud formation, lightning, thundering etc all takes place in the troposphere.<br />
ii. The Stratosphere extends from the top of the troposphere up to around 31 miles (50 km) above the Earth&#8217;s surface. In this region the temperature increases with height. Heat is produced due to the formation of ozone.<br />
iii. The mesosphere extends from the top of the stratosphere to about 53 miles (85 km) above the earth. The gases, including the oxygen molecules, continue to become thinner and thinner with height.<br />
iv. Above the mesosphere the thermosphere extends up to near 375 miles (600 km) above the earth. This layer is known as the upper atmosphere. As such, incoming high energy ultraviolet and x-ray radiation from the sun, absorbed by the molecules in this layer, causes a large temperature increase.<br />
v. Exosphere exists above the thermosphere.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 17</span><br />
Air pollution is of two main types:<br />
Natural: It is the pollution caused by nature. It includes forest fires, dust storms, pollen etc.<br />
Human made: It is the pollution caused by human activities. It includes burning of fossil fuels in industries, vehicles and thermoelectric plants, gaseous emission from industries, mining, processing and stone crushing.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 18</span><br />
When the water bodies get heated by solar radiations during the day, a large amount of water evaporates and goes in the air. The air carrying water vapours also gets heated. This hot air rises up carrying water vapours with it. As the air rises it expands and cools. This cooling causes the water vapours in the air to condense as tiny droplets which slowly grow bigger by the condensation of more water droplets and forms clouds.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 19</span><br />
Global warming: An increase in the carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere leads to global warming. The global warming is quite dangerous as it tends to melt polar ice and glaciers existing on mountains, rise in the water level of the oceans and submerge several coastal areas and islands. This could further lead to floods.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 20</span><br />
Ozone depletion is caused by certain chemicals called ozone depleting substances. They include chlorofluoro carbons, methyl bromide, nitrogen oxides and chlorine.<br />
Effects of ozone depletion:<br />
(i) Skin cancer.<br />
(ii) Damage of eyes.<br />
(iii) Damage of immune system.<br />
(iv) Decreased crop yields.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 21</span><br />
When fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum products are burnt, they produce oxides of nitrogen and sulphur. On dissolving in rain these oxides form nitric acid and sulphuric acid respectively. This causes acid rain. These acids wash down into the soil and make it highly acidic, thus, affecting the growth of plants and ultimately the forest growth. It also affects the surface of buildings by eroding the stone and brick works.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 22</span><br />
Rainwater harvesting is a technique used to capture and store rain water by making special water harvesting structures so that there is an increase in the recharge of underground water resources.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 23</span><br />
Climate is the average weather of an area. It represents the general pattern of atmospheric or weather conditions, seasonal variations and weather extremes, in a region over an extended period, say 50 years or 100 years. For example, desert areas have a hot climate whereas snowbound mountains have a cold climate.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 24</span><br />

Break down of bigger rocks into smaller mineral particles is called weathering. It is of 3 types:<br />
(i) Physical weathering: Various climatic factors such as temperature, wind, rain water, ice, snow, glaciers and running water contribute to physical weathering. Water and high temperature cause corrosive humidity and bring about unequal expansion and contraction of rocks, facilitating their break down.<br />
(ii) Chemical weathering: It involves a variety of chemical processes, such as hydrolysis, hydration, oxidation and reduction. The breakdown of complex compounds by the carbonic acids present in water and acidic substances derived from the decomposition of organic matter in soil, are examples of chemical weathering.<br />
(iii) Biological weathering: Is done by living organisms such as lichens and bryophytes. They create small crevices which deepen to form cracks in the rocks. Cracks gradually widen and cause slow fragmentation and eventually pulverisation of rocks.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 27</span><br />
The removal and transportation of the top layer of soil from its original position to another place, under the effect of strong winds and fast running rainwater is called soil erosion. Soil erosion can be prevented by :<br />
(i) Intensive cropping<br />
(ii) Sowing grasses and planting xerophytes.<br />
(iii) Terrace farming.<br />
(iv) Contour bunding.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 28</span><br />
Biological weathering: Is done by living organisms such as lichens and bryophytes. Lichens growing on rock surface extract minerals from the rocks. This creates small crevices at places where a thin layer of soil builds up. Mosses grow over these crevices causing deepening of crevices and results in the buildup of more soil inside them. The roots of short lived herbs also passes into them and the cracks gradually widen and cause slow fragmentation and eventually pulverisation of rocks.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 29</span><br />
Water is replenished in the seas by the means of water or hydrological cycle. We know that the oceans or seas are the largest global reservoir of water. Water evaporates from these reservoirs in large quantities and helps in the formation of clouds. The winds blows the clouds over to the lands where after getting cooled enough, the water in clouds falls on the earth or directly over the seas as rain and hail. Some water from rain and melting snow soaks into the ground, but most of it flows in rivers and returns directly to the seas.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 30</span><br />
Nitrogen fixation is the process of fixing free nitrogen into compounds. This takes place by the following means:<br />
(a) Certain blue-green algae and bacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen.<br />
(b) Nitrogen fixing bacteria found in the nodules of roots of legumes such as gram, bean, pulses etc. fix atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogen containing compounds.<br />
(c) Lightning also helps in the formation of nitrogen containing compounds.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 31</span><br />
Nitrogen exists as free nitrogen in the atmosphere. This free nitrogen is fixed into compounds of ammonia and nitrates. Most of the organisms cannot utilise nitrogen as molecular nitrogen. Plants take compounds containing nitrogen from the soil. From plants nitrogen passes into the food web. Decay of dead plants, animals and excreta causes return of nitrogen compounds to the soil. Denitrifying bacteria cause liberation of free nitrogen in the atmosphere.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 32</span><br />
Carbon is an important constituent of organic compounds found in all living beings in the form of carbohydrates, fats, proteins and nucleic acids. Carbon is trapped in the surrounding air and water in the form of carbon dioxide. The consumers devour the organic carbon compounds that producers manufacture. Through respiration, both consumers and producers return carbon to the non-living environment in the form of carbon dioxide. Some carbon accumulates in wood for many years and is eventually returned to the atmosphere by fires or through consumption and respiration by fungi, bacteria and other detrivores. Volcanic eruption also releases carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 33</span><br />
The dangers of global warming are:<br />
(i) It leads to the melting of polar ice caps and rise in sea level.<br />
(ii) Increase in the temperature of the earth due to green house effect will cause a change in weather and precipitation patterns on the earth.<br />
(iii) It leads to methane burp which is caused by the melting of methane hydrates in permafrost and on sea floor.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 34</span><br />
Carbon dioxide concentration in atmosphere is rising primarily because of two reasons: (i) Deforestation and (ii) Increased combustion of fossil fuels.<br />
As trees take in carbon dioxide from air and release oxygen back into the air, it helps in maintaining the desired levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But due to deforestation, trees are being cut down and this is leading to the increase in carbon dioxide levels.<br />
The increased combustion of fossil fuels also leads to the release of enormous amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 35</span><br />
Ozone layer is called ozone umbrella/shield because it filters out the harmful, high energy ultra violet radiations coming from the sun.<br />

In 1985, Farmen found that ozone layer had thinned out over Antarctica. It was called an ozone hole.<br />
Effects of widening of ozone hole are:<br />
(i) Skin cancer.<br />
(ii) Damage of eyes.<br />
(iii) Damage of immune system.<br />
(iv) Decreased crop yields.<br />

Water is one of the most important physical components which is essential for the survival of live on earth. Ocean is the biggest storehouse of water. Water on evaporation forms clouds and which after condensation falls down as rain. After rain, it passes through rivers and gets collected again in the ocean. The circulation of water in this manner is called water cycle. The cycle is also performed through living beings in the processes like absorption and transpiration of water by plants and drinking by animals. Animals lose water during respiration and evaporation, perspiration and excretion.<br />

The three aspects of nutrient cycling are:<br />
(i) Input of nutrients &#8211; An ecosystem receives the nutrients from an external source. It stores them for further use through biological processes.<br />
(ii) Output of nutrients &#8211; Nutrients move out of an ecosystem and many of them become input to another ecosystem.<br />
(iii) Internal nutrient cycling &#8211; Nutrients are continuously regenerated and stored in soil in forms available to plants. This is done by decomposers by the process of decomposition of detritus.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 43</span><br />
The organisms get water from and return it to the global water cycle. Plants absorb water from the soil or water reservoir and add it to the air in vapour form by a process called transpiration. Water transpired by trees cools the surrounding air. Animals take water from the water reservoir or with food and return it to the air and vapours by respiration or to the soil by excretion. Mammals also excrete water as sweat which evaporates from the water bodies. Water is added to the environment by the death and decay of organisms. Water vapour formed by transpiration and respiration form clouds and enters global water cycle. Rain adds water to the soil and reservoir for reuse by plants and animals. This completes the water cycle.<br />

Natural resources are living and non-living components of nature which are used by humans to meet their requirements. Since natural resources are available only from the Earth, they are called Earth resources.<br />
Based on their abundance, natural resources are of two main types, inexhaustible and exhaustible.<br />
(a) Inexhaustible natural resources: They are natural resources which occur in such abundance that they are not likely to get exhausted despite continuous use, e.g., air, water, solar energy.<br />
(b) Exhaustible natural resources: They are natural resources which are available in limited quantity. They may to get depleted by continuous and indiscriminate human consumption. Exhaustible resources are of two kinds, renewable and non-renewable.<br />
(i) Renewable resources: They are exhaustible resources which get replenished regularly. These are both living and non-living resources which can replenish themselves by quick recycling, e.g., forests, wildlife, soil and underground water. Renewable resources can last for ever if they are used responsibly.<br />
(ii) Non-renewable resources: They are exhaustible resources which once used cannot be replenished. Thus, these resources are non-living and cannot replenish themselves by recycling and replacement. If not used carefully they will ultimately get exhausted. Their increased consumption results in quicker exhaustion, e.g., minerals, fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 2</span><br />
Air contains oxygen. The latter is needed by most organisms and plants for all respiration to go on. It is therefore rightly called the breath of life. Air is an inexhaustible natural resource. In a world without air, there would be no plant or animal life, no winds, clouds or rain, no fires and no protection against harmful solar radiations. This is because the atmosphere covers the Earth, like a blanket. Air is a bad conductor of heat. The atmosphere keeps the average temperature of the Earth fairly steady during the day and even during the course of whole year. The atmosphere prevents the sudden increase in temperature during the daylight hours. And at night, atmosphere slows down the escape of heat into outer space.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 3</span><br />
The introduction of chemicals, particulate matter, or biological materials into the atmosphere that cause harm or irritate living organisms or damage the natural environment is known as air pollution.<br />
The major causes of air pollution can be in the form of solid particles, liquid droplets, or gas. There are many different chemical substances that contribute to air pollution. These chemicals come from a variety of sources. Among the many types of air pollutants are nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxides, and organic compounds that can evaporate and enter the atmosphere.<br />
Air pollutants have sources that are both natural and human. Humans contribute substantially more to the air pollution problem. Forest fires, volcanic eruptions, wind erosion, pollen dispersal, evaporation of organic compounds, and natural radioactivity are all among the natural causes of air pollution. Though some pollution comes from these natural sources, most pollution is the result of human activity. The biggest causes are the operation of fossil fuel-burning, power plants and automobiles that combust fuel.<br />
Effects of air pollution on human beings:<br />
(i) SPM (suspeneded particulate matter) causes asthma, bronchitis and allergic cold.<br />
(ii) Pollutant gases cause irritation in eyes, throat and lungs. Heart related diseases tend to increase.<br />
(iii) Hydrocarbon vapours not only damage the internal organs but also cause cancer.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 4</span><br />
The ozone layer is a deep layer in the stratosphere, encircling the Earth, which has large amounts of ozone in it. This layer shields the entire Earth from much of the harmful ultraviolet radiation that comes from the sun. Ozone is a special form of oxygen, made up of three oxygen atoms rather than the usual two oxygen atoms.<br />
It is formed when some type of radiation or electrical discharge separates the two atoms in an oxygen molecule (O2), which can then individually recombine with other oxygen molecules to form ozone (O3).<br />
Reduction in the concentration of ozone layer is called ozone depletion. Ozone depletion is caused by certain chemicals called ozone depleting substances. They include chlorofluoro carbons, methyl bromide, nitrogen oxides and chlorine.<br />
Effects of ozone depletion: Depleting ozone layer allows more ultraviolet (UV) radiations to pass through it, which reach the earth&#8217;s surface. These UV rays cause various harmful effects on human beings, animals, plants and environment such as:<br />
(i) Skin cancer.<br />
(ii) Damage of eyes.<br />
(iii) Damage of immune system.<br />
(iv) Decreased crop yields.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 5</span><br />
Sources of water pollution:<br />
(i) Sewage &#8211; Organic wastes are contributed as domestic and commercial sewage by food processing plants, dairy farms, piggeries, poultry farms, slaughter houses, breweries, tanneries, etc. Animal excreta is discharged into fields or dumped into pits reaches water bodies through run off and leaching, particularly during the rainy season.<br />
(ii) Industrial wastes &#8211; Effluents of mills and industries such as paper mills, petroleum refineries, etc., contain large quantities of harmful chemicals including acids, alkalis and heavy metals (e.g., mercury salts from paper industries) that are discharged into water bodies (rivers and lakes).<br />
(iii) Synthetic soaps and detergents &#8211; Water containing soaps and detergents is discharged from houses and certain factories.<br />
(iv) Fertilizers and pesticides &#8211; Fertilizers and pesticides are being used excessively in the fields to increase crop production. These are washed by rainwater into water bodies and pollute them.<br />
(v) Petroleum oil &#8211; Drilling and shipping operations are common in the oceans. Leakage of petroleum oil during such operations or due to accidents results in water pollution.<br />
(vi) Solid particles &#8211; Rain erodes soil and carries silt to water. Tiny suspended particles of clay and dust also settle in water from air. These soil particles cause turbidity.<br />
(vii) Thermal pollution &#8211; Discharge of hot water from industries and thermal plants into water body changes the normal temperature of the water. The content of oxygen decreases. Reduced oxygen content kills aquatic animals and reduces the rate of decomposition of organic matter which, therefore, accumulates.<br />
Harmful effects of Water pollution:<br />
(i) Human diseases &#8211; Diseases such as typhoid, cholera, dysentery, jaundice and hepatitis are caused due to water pollution.<br />
(ii) Disturbance in ecological balance &#8211; All types of water pollutants affect the life forms living in the water. These pollutants can encourage the growth of some life forms and harm some other life forms hence affecting the balance between various organisms.<br />
(iii) Removal of desirable substances from water bodies &#8211; With increase in the amount of organic wastes in water, bacteria multiply rapidly and use up the available oxygen. Lack of oxygen kills the fish and other animals.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 6</span><br />
(i) Eutrophication is nutrient enrichment (i.e., addition of nitrates and phosphates) of water body that results in the growth of aquatic plants, especially algae causing colouration of water known as algal bloom. It leads to depletion of dissolved oxygen in water resulting in killing of aquatic organisms (e.g., fish).<br />
(ii) The phenomenon of increase in the concentration of harmful non-biodegradable substances in the body of living organisms at each trophic level of the food chain is called biomagnification. Two heavy metals which are biomagnified are mercury and cadmium. Due to biomagnification fish-eating predatory birds such as kingfishers and loon become poisoned.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 7</span><br />
Living organisms need water because it plays a vital role in the reactions taking place within organism&#8217;s cells and body. Water acts as a universal solvent, providing a medium for the chemical reactions to occur. Substances are also transported from one part of body to the other in the dissolved state. Therefore, it is necessary for the organisms to maintain a distinct level of water within their bodies in order to stay alive. Terrestrial life forms require fresh water because their bodies cannot tolerate or get rid of the high amounts of the dissolved salts in saline water. So, water sources need to be easily accessible to animals and plants to survive on land.<br />
Thus, availability of water decides not only the number of individuals of each species that are able to survive in a particular area, but it also decides the diversity of life there.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 8</span><br />
Soil is a mixture of small particles of rocks and humus (i.e., organic matter obtained from decaying of living organisms or their wastes). Temperature variations due to radiations of the sun, rain water, winds and living organisms influence the formation of soil from the rocks involving two processes: weathering and paedogenesis.<br />
Breakdown of bigger rocks into small, fine soil particles is called weathering. It may occur due to physical, chemical or biological means. Under the influence of solar radiations, rocks heat up and expand. At night, these rocks cool down and contract. Since all the parts of rocks do not expand and contract at the same rate, cracks appear in the rocks and ultimately the large rocks breakdown into smaller pieces. Flow of water through or over the rocks makes the cracks bigger. Flowing/falling water also has an erasing effect on the rocks. On freezing the water expands in rock crevices and breaks the rocks. Similarly, strong winds continue to rub against hard rocks and erode them. Growth of lichens, mosses and other plants also influence the formation of soil by eroding the rocks over which they are growing.<br />
Paedogenesis: This process concludes the decomposition by bacteria and fungi, during which organic materials are broken down, leading to humification and mineralization. Detritivores such as nematods, earthworms, etc., consume organic matter and add excretory nitrogen to it. Thus, addition of organic matter (humus) from dead and decomposed plants and animals, is the final stage in soil formation.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 9</span><br />
Soil pollution is caused by solid wastes and chemicals. The slag heaps from mines spoil the beauty of sites of mines. Pulp and paper mills, sugar mills, oil refineries, power plants, chemicals fertilizer manufacturing units, iron and steel plants, plastic and rubber producing complexes are some major contributions to soil pollution. Most industrial furnaces and thermal power stations produce fly ash, which is a grey, powdery residue of unburnt material, and causes pollution. This fly ash hampers the growth of crop plants and also decreases crops of orchards. Domestic waste also adds a large amount of solid wastes. Modern farming practices involve the use of large amounts of fertilizers and pesticides. Use of these substances over long period of time can destroy the soil structure by killing the soil microorganisms that recycle nutrients in the soil. It also kills the earthworms which are helpful in making the rich humus. Fertile soils can quickly become barren if sustainable practices are not followed.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 10</span><br />
The removal and transportation of top soil from its original position to another place with the help of certain agents such as strong winds and fast running waters, is called soil erosion.<br />
Causes of Soil Erosion:<br />
1. Strong winds: The soil which is uncovered and loose, is eroded, when it is exposed to strong winds. The winds carry away the fine soil particles to other places.<br />
2. Heavy rains: When rain falls on the unprotected top soil, rain water washes it down into the streams and rivers, etc.<br />
3. Human actions: Human activities such as expansion of urban areas has led to removal of vegetation from certain regions. The bare land is thus exposed to agencies (winds, rains) of soil erosion.<br />
Effects of Soil Erosion:<br />
1. Loss of fertility and desertification: Soil erosion results in the displacement of the top soil from one region to another, thus, reducing its fertility. When the top fertile soil is constantly removed from a region, only infertile sub-soil is left behind. In such a soil, only sparse vegetation can grow. This way, soil erosion gradually turns lush green areas into deserts.<br />
2. Landslides in hilly areas: Barren hills or hills with sparse vegetation are constantly exposed to heavy rain fall that makes the top soils of hills loose. Due to soil erosion, rock pieces of various sizes and loose soil from hills, suddenly slide down the steep slopes of mountains/hills. This phenomenon is called landslides. When these rock pieces and soil block the narrow river bed they result in floods. Sometimes, landslides block the roads and disrupt hill-life.<br />
3. Flash floods: Vegetation in the hilly regions absorb a lot of rain water and keep the top soil intact. Barren hills or hills with sparse vegetation cannot absorb much rain water and thus can not keep the soil intact. So, heavy rains result in rapid movement of water in the areas resulting in flash floods in lower areas causing enormous loss to life and property.<br />
Prevention of soil erosion:<br />
1. Intensive cropping: If the fields remain covered with crops throughout the year, their top soil will not be exposed to winds or rains. In such a condition, no soil erosion will occur.<br />
2. Sowing grasses and planting xerophytes: Soil should not be left uncovered. Sowing grasses on barren soil or planting of xerophytes will bind the loose soil. The roots of grasses and xerophytes hold the soil in place. Vegetative cover on the ground also helps in percolating water into deeper layers of soil.<br />
3. Terrace farming (terracing): In terracing the slopes are divided into a number of flat fields to slow down the flow of water. In hilly regions, small crop fields are thus formed in the form of steps on terraces for cultivation of crops. Such terrace farms reduced the flow of rain water down the slopes of hills. Moreover, eroded soil from upper regions of hills gets deposited in lower terraces.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 11</span><br />
The continuous process by which nitrogen is exchanged between organisms and the environment is called nitrogen cycle. Nitrogen is an essential nutrient, needed to make amino acids and other important organic compounds, but most organisms cannot use free nitrogen, which is abundant as a gas in the atmosphere.<br />
Nitrogen cycle involves the following steps:<br />
(i) Nitrogen fixation: This process involves the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into nitrates, which are soluble in water. This is done by various nitrogen fixing bacteria. Example &#8211; Rhizobium, blue green algae and bacterium Azotobacter.<br />
(ii) Ammonification: It is the process of decomposing complex, dead organic matter into ammonia. This is done by microorganisms living in the soil.<br />
(iii) Nitrification: It is the process of conversion of ammonia into nitrites and then into nitrates. This is done by nitrifying bacteria. Example &#8211; Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter.<br />
(iv) Denitrification: It is the process of reducing nitrates present in the soil to release nitrogen back into the atmosphere. Example &#8211; Pseudomonas.<br />
The decomposers help in decomposing the dead bodies of plants and animals, and hence act as cleansing agents of environment. The decomposers also help in putting back the various elements of which the dead plants and animals were made, back into the soil, air and water for reuse by the producers like crop-plants, e.g. the decomposers like purifying bacteria and fungi decompose the dead plants and animal bodies into ammonia. This ammonia is converted into nitrates by nitrifying bacteria present in soil. These nitrates act as fertilizer in the soil and are again absorbed by the plants for their growth. Thus, the nitrates act as fertilizer in the biosphere so that the process of life may go on and on like an unending chain.</p>

Advantages of manures are:<br />
(i) Manures are natural fertilizers.<br />
(ii) Manures are bulky sources of organic matter which supply nutrients in small quantity and organic matter in large quantities.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 07:</span><br />
Limitations of using manures are:<br />
(i) Manures are not nutrient specific.<br />
(ii) Manures are not able to fulfill the high and rapid demand of nutrients required by improved high-yielding hybrid varieties of crops.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 08;</span><br />
Manure contains many organic substances of biological origin which can be easily degraded and absorbed by plants. It helps in recycling of biological waste. Manures increase the fertility of soil for long duration without causing any harm. However, the chemical fertilizers (e.g. urea) improve soil fertility for short duration but cause environmental hazard. Continuous use of fertilizers in a particular area / crop field causes destruction of soil fertility.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 09:</span><br />
Advantages of fertilizer over manure:<br />
(i) Fertilizers are very rich in plant nutrient whereas manure contains small amounts of essential plant nutrients.<br />
(ii) Fertilizers are soluble in water whereas manure is not soluble in water.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 10:</span><br />
As a result of this, the pond water would acquire a high concentration of nitrates and phosphates which would result in the excessive growth of algae and phytoplankton in the pond.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 11:</span><br />
Eutrophication is a process whereby water bodies, such as lakes or slow-moving streams receive excess nutrients that stimulate excessive plant growth (algae, phytoplankton&#8217;s and nuisance plants weeds). This enhanced plant growth is also termed as an algal bloom.<br />
Example: During rains the nutrients from the fields are washed away and get accumulated in nearby water bodies.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 12:</span><br />
The continuous use of chemical fertilizers in a particular area or crop field leads to loss of soil fertility.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 13:</span><br />
There are three methods of fertilizer applications in practice:<br />
(i) Broadcasting: Uniform distribution over the whole cropped field.<br />
(ii) Placement: Application in bands or in pockets near the plants or plant rows.<br />
(iii) Foliar application: Using low or high volume sprayers, the fertilizers are sprayed covering the plants.<br />

Farmyard Manure<br />
It is the decomposed mixture of cattle excreta, dung, urine, litter and left over organism matter such as roughage and Fodder.<br />
Compost Manure<br />
It is prepared from farm and town refuge such as vegetable and animal refuse.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 15:</span><br />
Manure &#8211; Manures are natural fertilizers. They are bulky sources of organic matter which supply nutrients in small quantities, and organic matter in large quantities. There are different types of manures: Farmyard manure (FYM), Compost, Green manures and Vermicompost.<br />
Manures affect the soil in following three ways:<br />
(i) Manures enrich the soil with nutrients. They replenish the general deficiency of nutrients in the soil. Since manure contains fewer nutrients they need to be used in large quantities.<br />
(ii) Manures add organic matter (called humus) to the soil which restores the soil texture, for better retention of water and aeration of soil.<br />
(iii) The organic matter in manures provides food for the soil organisms, (decomposers such as bacteria, fungi, etc. which help in providing nutrients to plants.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 16:</span><br />
Green manuring is the practice which includes growing, mulching by ploughing and mixing of green crops with soil, to improve physical structure and soil fertility.<br />

<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 17:</span><br />
Fertilizers &#8211; Fertilizers are one of the major components for obtaining higher yields especially in expensive farming practices. Fertilizers are divided into following four groups:<br />
(i) Nitrogenous fertilizers &#8211; These fertilizers supply the macronutrient nitrogen.<br />
Example &#8211; Urea, CO(NH2)2<br />
(ii) Potassic fertilizers &#8211; These fertilizers supply potassium which is one of the essential macronutrient of the plants.<br />
Example &#8211; Potassium sulphate, K2SO4.<br />
(iii) Complex fertilizers &#8211; These fertilizers contains two or more nutrients.<br />
Example &#8211; Nitrophosphate<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 18:</span><br />
Biofertilisers &#8211; Organisms which enrich the soil with nutrients are called biofertilisers. Biofertilisers are used for the specific crop plants such as pulses, legumes, oil seeds and rice. They are renewable and non-pollutant sources of plant nutrient such as nitrogen.<br />
Nitrogen fixing microorganisms, i.e., non-symbiotic and symbiotic cyanobacteria and phosphate-solubilising microorganism are the main type of biofertilisers.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 19:</span><br />
A legume crop does not require nitrogenous fertilizers because its roots have root nodules which have nitrogenous bacteria called Rhizobium. This bacteria fixes atmospheric nitrogen and the plants converts nitrogen into various nitrogenous compounds.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 20:</span><br />
Irrigation is essential for the absorption of nutrient elements by the crop plants from the soil. The irrigation water tends to dissolve the nutrients present in the soil of a crop field to form a Solution. This Solution of nutrients is then absorbed by the roots of crops for the development of the plants.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 21:</span><br />

<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 3:</span><br />
Manures are rich in organic matter but are poor supplier of nutrients. So, the cultivated field which is not supplied with fertilizers may suffer from the deficiency of nutrients and not give very good yield.<br />
The cultivated field which is supplied with fertilizers only may face drainage problem and water logging due to lack of organic matter in the soil. This may harm the crop and the yield. Use of fertilizers over long periods of time can destroy the soil texture by killing the microorganisms that recycle nutrients in the soil.</p>

Irrigation is the process of supplying water to crop plants by means of canals, wells, reservoirs, tube-wells, etc.<br />
Irrigation is necessary in the areas where there is scarcity and irregular distribution of rain that can cause drought. It provides sufficient moisture for the germination of seeds, as seeds do not germinate in dry soil. It is also necessary for the growth and development of crop plants. The irrigation water tends to dissolve the nutrients present in the soil and forms a Solution which is easily absorbed by the roots of the plants.<br />
Excessive irrigation causes water logging and increases surface salinity. In water logged soil, plants do not get proper aeration.</p>
<p><span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 5:</span><br />
The various types of irrigation systems are &#8211;<br />
(i) Canal system: In this system, the human-made canals receive water from one or two reservoirs or from rivers. The main canal is distributed into branch canals which have further distributaries or field channels.<br />
(ii) Tanks: These are small storage reservoirs which catch and store the runoff of smaller catchment areas.<br />
(iii) Wells: These are of two types &#8211; dug wells and tube wells. In dug wells, water is collected from water bearing strata. The water from the shallow strata slowly accumulates in the pit and water is lifted by mechanical means. A tube well can tap water from the deeper strata.<br />
(iv) River lift system: It is more useful in the areas where canal flow is insufficient or irregular due to inadequate water release. In this system, water is directly drawn from the rivers for supplement irrigation.<br />
(v) River valley system: Certain parts of the country such as Karnataka and Kerala which lie along the Western Ghats use water that is discharged into the steep and narrow riverine valleys, during the rainy season. The bottom flat lands of the valleys are used for growing crops.<br />
(vi) Drip and sprinkler system: It employs the overhead pipes for spraying water.<br />
Efficiency of applied water can be increased by rain water harvesting and water shed management.</p>

The heat energy that has to applied to change the state of a substance is called &#8216;latent heat&#8217;. They are of two types:<br />
(i) Latent heat of fusion and (ii) Latent heat of vaporization.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 25</span><br />
When a solid is heated, the heat energy makes its particles vibrate more vigorously. At the melting point, the particles of solid have sufficient energy to overcome the strong forces of attraction holding them in fixed positions and break to form small groups of particles. This heat energy is kinetic energy.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 26</span><br />
When a change of state of a substance has to take place the heat given would not raise the temperature.<br />
<strong>Lakhmir Singh Chemistry Class 9 solutions Page No: 37</strong><br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 27</span><br />
The heat energy supplied to ice during the change of state (at its melting point) is all used up in overcoming (or breaking) the force of attraction between its particles without increasing its kinetic energy. Since the heat (or latent heat) supplied during the change of state does not increase the kinetic energy of the ice cubes, therefore no rise in temperature takes place. The temperature remains constant.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 28</span><br />
The heat energy supplied to water during the change of state (at its boiling point) is all used up in overcoming (or breaking) the force of attraction between its particles without increasing its kinetic energy. Since the heat (or latent heat) supplied during the change of state does not increase the kinetic energy of the water, therefore no rise in temperature takes place. The temperature remains constant.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 29</span><br />
This is due to the fact that for melting, each kilogram of ice takes its latent heat of 3.34 x 105 joules from the substance and hence cools the substance more effectively. On the other hand, water at 0o cannot take any such latent heat from the substance.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 30</span><br />
We would place ice in the water to cool it more quickly because the ice takes its latent heat from the water and hence cools it more effectively. On the other hand, if we keep the water on ice then the latent heat would be taken from the surrounding air hence releasing its coolness to the surrounding and not the water.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 31</span><br />
Steam causes more severe burns than boiling water because the steam contains more heat, in the form of latent heat, than boiling water. Hence, when steam falls on our skin and condenses to produce water, it gives out 22.5 x 105 Joules per kilogram more heat than boiling water.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 32</span><br />
The latent heat of fusion of ice is 3.34 x 105 J/Kg. It means that 3.34x 105 joules of heat is required to change 1 Kg of ice at its melting point of 0oC into water at the same temperature (of 0oC). This means that 1 Kg of ice at 0oC has 3.34 x 105 joules of less heat than 1 kg of water at the same temperature of 0oC.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 33</span><br />
1 Kg of steam at 100oC has more heat than water at the same temperature because when water changes into steam, it absorbs latent heat, but when steam condenses to form water, an equal amount of latent heat is given out.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 34</span><br />
It is because of the fact that steam at 100oC contains more heat, in the form of latent heat, than boiling water at 100oC. Hence, steam would give out 22.5 x 105 joules per kilogram more heat than boiling water.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 35</span><br />

The temperature of a substance remains constant during the change of state because the heat gets used up in changing the state by overcoming the forces of attraction between the particles.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 37</span><br />
(a) Either solid (as ice) or liquid as 0oC is the melting point of ice as well as the freezing point of water.<br />

(d) Gas.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 38</span><br />
The temperature of a substance remains constant during the change of state though heat is supplied continuously because the heat gets used up in changing the state by overcoming the forces of attraction between the particles.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 39</span><br />
The temperature, at which a solid substance melts and changes into a liquid at atmospheric pressure, is called melting point of the substance. The melting point of ice is 0oC.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 40</span><br />
The temperature, at which a liquid boils and changes rapidly into a gas at atmospheric pressure, is called boiling point of the liquid. The boiling point of water is 100oC.<br />

(a) Condensation &#8211; The process of changing a gas (or vapour) to a liquid by cooling is called condensation.<br />
(b) Freezing &#8211; The process of changing a liquid into a solid by cooling, is called freezing.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 43</span><br />
This happens because naphthalene balls undergo sublimation. The naphthalene balls keep on forming naphthalene vapours slowly which disappear into the air.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 44</span><br />
Gases can be liquefied by applying pressure and lowering temperature. The temperature needs to be lowered because when the gas is compressed too much, then heat is produced due to compression. Cooling lowers the temperature of the compressed gas and helps in liquefying it.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 45</span><br />
Ammonia gas is liquefied by applying high pressure and lowering the temperature of the gas. Lowering the temperature is done by continuously pouring water over the coils carrying the compressed gas.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 46</span><br />
There is a lot of space between the particles of a gas. If enough pressure is applied to the gas, it gets highly compressed. The particles of gas get so close together that they start attracting each other sufficiently to form a liquid. And we say that the gas has liquefied.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 47</span><br />
On a hot day, when our body temperature tends to rise too much, our sweat glands give out moisture (sweat) on our skin. When this sweat evaporates, it takes the latent heat of vaporization from our body hence making our body cool.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 48</span><br />
All water on earth does not get evaporated on hot summer days because of the high value of latent heat of vaporization of water.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 49</span><br />
Liquids like alcohol, petrol and perfume are volatile (which can change into vapours easily). When we apply alcohol to the back of our hand, we find that it dries up quickly and while it is drying, the hands feel cold. This happens due to the fact that to change from liquid to the vapour state, alcohol requires latent heat of vaporization. The alcohol takes this latent heat of vaporization from the hand due to which the hand loses heat and we feel cold.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 50</span><br />
The cooling in a desert room cooler is caused by the evaporation of water. The higher temperature on a hot day increases the rate of evaporation of water, and the dryness of air also increases the rate of evaporation of water. And due to this increased rate of evaporation of water, a desert room cooler works better on a hot and dry day.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 51</span><br />
The earthen pot (or matka) has a large number of extremely small pores on its walls. Some of the water kept in the earthen pot continuously keeps seeping through these pores to the outside of the pot. This water evaporates continuously by taking the latent heat of vaporization from the earthen pot and the remaining water. In this way, the earthen pot and remaining water loses heat and gets cooled.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 52</span><br />
We should wear cotton clothes in hot summer days because we perspire more through the pores of the skin during such days. Since, sweat is mainly water and cotton clothes are good absorber of water, they absorb the sweat quickly and expose it to the atmosphere for evaporation. The evaporation of sweat from the cotton clothes takes the latent heat of vaporization from our skin hence the skin loses heat and makes us feel cool and comfortable.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 53</span><br />
If the hot tea or milk is taken in a cup, then due to the narrow shape of the cup, the surface area of hot tea in the cup is comparatively small. Due to this, the evaporation of hot tea is slow; cooling caused by evaporation is less and hence the hot tea remains appreciably hot for a much longer time. On the other hand, the saucer has a large surface area due to which the tea taken in the saucer evaporates much faster, thus cooling it quickly and making it convenient to sip or drink.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 54</span><br />
Acetone (or perfume) is volatile in nature. When we apply it to our palm, we feel cold. This happens due to the fact that to change from liquid to the vapour state, acetone requires latent heat of vaporization. Acetone takes this latent heat of vaporization from the hand due to which the palm loses heat and feels cold.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 55</span><br />
The presence of water vapour in air can be demonstrated by the following experiment: We take a steel tumbler and put some well crushed ice in it. Allow the steel tumbler to stand undisturbed for about 5 minutes with the ice in it. We would observe that a large number of tiny drops of water appear on the outer surface of the steel tumbler. This happens because the air around the steel tumbler contains water vapour in it. When these water vapour come in contact with the cold, outside surface of steel tumbler, they condense to form tiny drops of liquid.<br />

(a) The process of a liquid changing into vapour (or gas) even below its boiling point is called evaporation. The factors affecting rate of evaporation are:<br />
(i) Temperature.<br />
(ii) Surface area.<br />
(iii) Humidity.<br />
(iv) Wind speed.<br />
(b) Evaporation causes cooling because when a liquid evaporates, it draws or takes the latent heat of vaporisation from &#8216;anything&#8217; which it touches and hence the substances or surroundings lose heat and get cooled.<br />

What type of motion, uniform or non-uniform, is exhibited by a freely falling body ? Give reason for your solution.<br />
<span style="color: #yellow;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
A freely falling body has non-uniform motion because it covers smaller distances in the initial &#8216;1 second&#8217; intervals and larger distances in the later &#8216;1 second&#8217; intervals, i.e., it covers unequal distances in equal intervals of time.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow;"><strong>Question 22:</strong></span><br />

Arrange the following speeds in increasing order (keeping the least speed first):</p>
<ol>
<li>An athlete running with a speed of 10 m/s.</li>
<li>A bicycle moving with a speed of 200 m/min.</li>
<li>A scooter moving with a speed of 30 km/h.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #yellow;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Speed of athelete = 10 m/s<br />
Speed of bicycle = 200 m/min = 200/60 m/s = 3.33 m/s<br />
Speed of scooter = 30 km/h = 30000/3600 m/s = 8.33 m/s<br />
3.33 m/s &lt; 8.33 m/s &lt; 10 m/s<br />

<span style="color: #yellow;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
A body is said to be in motion when its position changes continuously with respect to a stationary object taken as reference point.<br />
A body has uniform motion if it travels equal distances in equal intervals of time, no matter how small these time intervals may be. For example: a car running at a constant speed of 10m/s, will cover equal distance of 10m every second, so its motion will be uniform.<br />
Non-uniform motion: A body has a non-uniform motion if it travels unequal distances in equal intervals of time. For example: dropping a ball from the roof of a tall building .</p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"><strong>Question 20:<br />
d2</strong></span>What is the difference between uniform linear motion and uniform circular motion ? Explain with examples.<br />
<span style="color: #yellow;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Uniform linear motion is uniform motion along a linear path or a straight line. T he direction of motion is fixed. So, it is not accelerated. For e.g.: a car running with uniform speed of 10km/hr on a straight road.<br />
Uniform circular motion is uniform motion along a circular path. T he direction of motion changes continuously. So, it is accelerated. For e.g.: motion of earth around the sun.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow;"><strong>Question 21:<br />

<span style="color: #yellow;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
An important characteristic of uniform circular motion is that the direction of motion in it changes continuously with time, so it is accelerated.<br />
Centripetal force brings about uniform circular motion.</p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"><strong>Question 38:<br />
</strong></span>Show by means of graphical method that: v = u + at, where the symbols have their usual meanings.<br />
<span style="color: #yellow;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Consider the velocity-time graph of a body shown in figure.<br />
The body has an initial velocity u at a point A and then its velocity changes at a uniform rate from A to B in time t. In other words, there is a uniform acceleration a from A to B, and after time t its final velocity becomes v which is equal to BC in the graph. The time t is represented by OC. To complete the figure, we draw the perpendicular CB from point C, and draw AD parallel to OC. BE is the perpendicular from point B to OE.<br />
Now, Initial velocity of the body, u= OA &#8212;&#8211;(1)<br />
And,Final velocity of the body, v=BC &#8212;&#8212;(2)<br />
But from the graph BC =BD + DC<br />
Therefore, v=BD + DC &#8212;&#8212;(3)<br />
Again DC = OA<br />
So,v =BD + OA<br />
Now, from equation (1), OA =u<br />
So, v=BD + u &#8212;&#8212;(4)<br />
We should find out the value of BD now. We know the slope of a velocity-time graph is equal to the acceleration, a.<br />
Thus,Acceleration, a= slope of line AB<br />
<sub>or a = BD/AD</sub><br />
But AD =OC= t, so putting t in place of AD in the above relation, we get:<br />
or BD=at<br />
Now, putting this value of BD in equation(4), we get:<br />
v= u+ at<br />

<span style="color: #yellow;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Consider the velocity-time graph of a body shown in figure. The body has an initial velocity u at a point A and then its velocity changes at a uniform rate from A to B in time t. In other words, there is a uniform acceleration a from A to B, and after time t its final velocity becomes v which is equal to BC in the graph. The time t is represented by OC.<br />
Suppose the body travels a distance s in time t. In the figure, the distance travelled by the body is given by the area of the space between the velocity-time graph AB and the time axis OC, which is equal to the area of the figure OABC. Thus:<br />
Distance travelled = Area of figure OABC<br />
= Area of rectangle OADC + area of triangle ABD<br />
Now, we will find out the area of rectangle OADC and area of triangle ABD.<br />
(i) Area of rectangle OADC =OA x OC<br />
= u x t<br />
=ut<br />
(ii) Area of triangle ABD= <sub>(1/2)</sub>x Area of rectangle AEBD<br />
= <sub>(1/2) </sub> x AD x BD<br />
= <sub>(1/2)</sub> x t x at<br />

Consider the velocity-time graph of a body shown in figure. The body has an initial velocity u at a point A and then its velocity changes at a uniform rate from A to B in time t. In other words, there is a uniform acceleration a from A to B, and after time t its final velocity becomes v which is equal to BC in the graph. The time t is represented by OC. To complete the figure, we draw the perpendicular CB from point C, and draw AD parallel to OC. BE is the perpendicular from point B to OE.<br />
The distance travelled s by a body in time t is given by the area of the figure OABC which is a trapezium.<br />
Distance travelled, s= Area of trapezium OABC<br />
Now, OA + CB = u + v and OC =t Putting these values in the above relation, we get:<br />
Eliminate t from the above equation. This can be done by obtaining the value of t from the first equation of motion.<br />

According to question-<br />
21.5 g of NaCl dissolves in 60 g of water.<br />
So, amount of NaCl which gets dissolved in 100 g of water = 21.5 x 100 / 60 = 35.8 g<br />
Thus, the solubility of NaCl is 35.8 g at 25oC.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 38</span><br />

(a). The maximum amount of a solute which can be dissolved in 100 g of a solvent at a specified temperature is known as the solubility of that solute in that solvent .<br />
The solubility of solids in liquids is directly proportional to temperature whereas the solubility of gases in liquids is inversly proportional to temperature.<br />
(b). This statement means that 100 g of water can dissolve a maximum of 20.7 g of copper sulphate at 20oC.<br />
(c). The solubility of solids in liquids increases on increasing the temperature and decreases on decreasing the temperature.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 49</span><br />
(a). A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances.<br />

(b). A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the small particles of a solid are spread throughout a liquid without dissolving in it.<br />
Example- Muddy-water, Milk of magnesia.<br />
(c). A colloid is a kind of solution in which the size of solute particles is intermediate between those in true solutions and those in suspensions.<br />
Example- Soap solution, milk.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 50</span><br />
(a). A solution in which no more solute can be dissolved at that temperature is called a saturated solution while a solution in which more quantity of solute can be dissolved without raising its temperature is called an unsaturated solution.<br />
To test the saturation or unsaturation of a solution, more solute may be added to the solution. If that solute gets dissolved in the solution then the solution will be unsaturated.<br />
To test whether a given solution is saturated or not, add some more solute to the solution and try to dissolve it by stirring. If solute does not dissolve in the given solution, then it will be a saturated solution.<br />
(b). Take some water in a beaker and heat it slowly with the help of burner. Now, start adding sodium chloride salt to the hot water with a spoon and stir it with a glass rod continuously so that sodium chloride goes on dissolving in water. Take the temperature of water up to 25oC and then keeping this temperature constant, go on adding sodium chloride till no more sodium chloride dissolves in it and some undissolved crystals will be left at the bottom. The contents of the beaker are now filtered and the clear solution obtained is the saturated solution of sodium chloride at 25oC.<br />
If the temperature is lowered from 25oC to 10oC, then some of the crystals of sodium chloride will separate out from the solution in the form of solute crystals.</p>

The mixture of common salt and ammonium chloride is taken in a china dish and placed on a tripod stand. The china dish is covered with an inverted glass funnel. A loose cotton plug is put in the upper, open end of the funnel to prevent the ammonium chloride vapours from escaping into the atmosphere. The china dish is heated by using a burner. On heating the mixture, ammonium chloride changes into white vapours. These vapours rise up and get converted into solid ammonium chloride on coming in contact with the cold, inner walls of the funnel. In this way, pure ammonium chloride collects on the inner sides of the funnel in the form of a sublimate and can be removed. Common salt does not change into vapours on heating, so it remains behind in the china dish and can be separated out.<br />

A mixture of common salt and water can be separated completely by the process of distillation. The distillation can be used to separate a liquid from dissolved non-volatile solids.<br />
The salt water mixture is taken in the distillation flask A and heated. Some porcelain pieces are put in the distillation flask to avoid bumping of the solution due to uneven heating. On heating, water forms vapours which rise up and come out through the side tube B of the distillation flask, and go into water condenser C. Cold water from tap is circulated through the outer tube of condenser for cooling the vapours. The hot vapours get cooled in the condenser to form pure water (i.e. distilled water) which trickles down from the condenser and collects in the beaker D. Since the salt is non-volatile, so it remains behind in the distillation flask.<br />

In cities, drinking water is supplied from water works where river or lake water is made free from suspended solid substances and germs. In water works, the methods like sedimentation, decantation, loading, filtration and chlorination etc. are used to remove undesirable materials from water. The source of water supply in a city is either a nearby river or lake (reservoir), from there it is pumped into &#8216;sedimentation tank&#8217;. Here it is allowed to stand for sometime so that many of insoluble substances present in water settle down at bottom of the tank. From there, it is sent to a &#8216;loading tank&#8217; where some alum is added to water. Here suspended clay particles in water get loaded with alum particles, become heavy and settle down at the bottom of the tank. Then, it is passed through &#8216;filtration tank&#8217;. It has three layers: fine sand layer at top, coarse sand layer in middle and gravel as the bottom layer. These act as filters and even the small suspended particles get removed when water passes through these layers. Then, the clear water is passed into a chlorination tank. Here, chlorine is added to water to kill the germs present in it. Now, the clean and disinfected water is pumped by pumping station into high storage tanks and from there, it is supplied to homes and factories through the network of big and small pipes.<br />

(a) Fractional distillation is the process of separating two or more miscible liquids (liquids which mix together in all proportions and form a single layer) by distillation, the distillate being collected in fractions boiling at different temperatures. The separation of two liquids by fractional distillation depends on the difference in their boiling points. It is carried out by using a fractionating column.<br />
Fractionating column is a long vertical glass tube filled with glass beads. The glass beads provide a large surface area for hot vapours to cool and condens repeatedly. It provides different temperature zones inside it, the highest temperature being at the bottom of the column and the lowest temperature near its top. It is fitted in the neck of the distillation flask.<br />

(a)Air is mixture of gases like nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, helium, neon, krypton, xeon etc. The various gases of air are separated from one another by fractional distillation of liquid air. This separation is based on the fact that different gases of air have different boiling points(in liquid form).<br />
The air is first filtered to remove dust, then water vapour and carbon dioxide are removed. Air is compressed to a high pressure and then cooled. The cooled air is then allowed to expand quickly into a chamber through a jet. This cools the air even more. This process of compression, cooling and rapid expansion of air is repeated again and again to make the air more and more cool so that it becomes liquid air. Now, the liquid air is fed into a tall fractionating column and warmed up slowly.<br />
Liquid nitrogen has lowest boiling point of -196oC.So, on warming, it boils off first to form nitrogen gas and is collected at the upper part of the fractional distillation column. Liquid argon has a slightly higher boiling point of -186oC. So, it boils off next and collected as argon gas in the middle part of fractional distillation column. Liquid oxygen has a still higher boiling point of -183 oC. So, liquid oxygen boils off last and collected as oxygen gas at the bottom of fractional distillation column.<br />

<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 26:</strong></span><br />
Which of the two, balanced forces or unbalanced forces, can change the shape of an object ? Give an example to illustrate your solution.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Balanced forces can change the shape of the object. For example, when a balloon is pressed between hands, then balanced forces (equal and opposite forces) act on the balloon due to which the shape of the balloon changes.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 27:</strong></span><br />
Describe the term &8216;inertia&8217; with respect to motion.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Inertia of motion is the property of a body due to which it resists a change in its state of uniform motion. For eg., if there is no air resistance and no friction to oppose the motion of a moving bicycle, it will go on moving forever.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 28:</strong></span><br />
State Newton&8217;s first law of motion. Give two examples to illustrate Newton&8217;s first law of motion.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Newton&8217;s first law of motion states that a body at rest will remain at rest, and a body in motion will continue in motion in a straight line with a uniform speed unless it is compelled by an external force to change its state of rest or of uniform motion. For example, a book lying on a table remains on the table unless we lift it with the force of our hands. And, on a frictionless surface, a moving car continues to be in the state of motion until brakes are applied on it.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 29:</strong></span><br />
On what factor does the inertia of a body depend ? Which has more inertia, a cricket ball or a rubber ball of the same size ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Inertia of a body depends on its mass. A cricket ball has more inertia than a rubber ball of the same size because it has more mass than the rubber ball.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 30:</strong></span><br />
Why do the passengers in a bus tend to fall backward when it starts suddenly ?<br />
<span style="color:purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
When a bus starts suddenly, its passengers tend to fall backwards because due to their inertia, the passengers tend to remain in a state of rest even when the bus starts moving.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 31:</strong></span><br />
Explain why, a person travelling in a bus falls forward when the bus stops suddenly.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
When a bus stops suddenly, its passengers tend to fall forward because due to their inertia, the passengers tend to remain in a state of motion even though the bus has come to rest.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 32:</strong></span><br />
Give reason for the following :<br />
When a hanging carpet is beaten with a stick, the dust particles start coming out of it.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
When a hanging carpet is beaten with a stick, the carpet moves to and fro with the force of the stick while the dust particles remain in their state of rest on account of their inertia and thus dust particles separate out from the carpet.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 33:</strong></span><br />
When a tree is shaken, its fruits and leaves fall down: Why ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
When a tree is shaken, the tree moves to and fro while the fruits and leaves remain in their state of rest on account of their inertia and thus fruits and leaves separate from the tree and fall from the tree.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 34:</strong></span><br />
Explain why, it is dangerous to jump out of a moving bus.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
It is dangerous to jump out of a moving bus because the jumping man, who is moving with the high speed of the bus would tend to remain in state of motion due to inertia even on falling to the ground and get hurt due to resistance offepurple by the ground.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 35:</strong></span><br />
What is the momentum in kg.m/s of a 10 kg car travelling at (a) 5 m/s (b) 20 cm/s, and (c) 36 km/h ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Mass of car, m = 10 kg<br />
Momentum = m x v<br />
a) Velocity, v = 5 m/s Momentum = 10 x 5 = 50 kg.m/s<br />
b) Velocity, v = 20 cm/s = 0.2 m/s Momentum = 10 x 0.2 = 2 kg.m/s<br />
c) Velocity, v = 36km/hr = 10 m/s Momentum = 10 x 10 = 100 kg.m/s</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 36:</strong></span><br />
(a) Define momentum of a body. On what factors does the momentum of a body depend ?<br />
(b) Calculate the change in momentum of a body weighing 5 kg when its velocity decreases from 20 m/s to 0.20 m/s.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a) Momentum is the physical quantity which is the measure of the quantity of motion of a moving body. It depends on mass and velocity of the body.<br />
b) Mass of body = 5 kg<br />
Velocity v<sub>1</sub> = 20 m/s<br />
Momentum p<sub>1</sub> = 20 x 5 = 100 kg.m/s<br />
Velocity v<sub>2</sub> = 0.2 m/s<br />
Momentum p<sub>2</sub> = 5 x 0.2 = 1 kg.m/s<br />
Change in momentum = p<sub>2</sub>&8211; p<sub>1</sub>= 1-100 = -99 kg.m/s (Negative sign shows that momentum decreases)</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 37:</strong></span><br />

(b) a force stops a moving body.<br />
(c) a force changes the speed of a moving body.<br />
(d) a force changes the direction of a moving body.<br />
(e) a force changes the shape (and size) of a body.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a) Kicking a stationary football.<br />
b) Applying brakes to a moving bicycle.<br />

<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 39:</strong></span><br />
(a) What do you understand by the terms &8220;balanced forces&8221; and &8220;unbalanced forces&8221; ? Explain with examples.<br />
(b) What type of forces &8211; balanced or unbalanced &8211; act on a rubber ball when we press it between our hands ? What effect is produced in the ball ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a) If the resultant of all the forces acting on a body is zero, the forces are called balanced forces. These forces do not change the state of rest or of uniform motion of a body but can change the shape of the body. For example, when a balloon is pressed between hands, then balanced forces (equal and opposite forces) act on the balloon due to which the shape of the balloon changes.<br />
If the resultant of all the forces acting on a body is not zero, the forces are called unbalanced forces. These forces change the state of rest or of uniform motion of a body. For eg., if we push a toy car lying on the ground, it starts moving due to the unbalanced force exerted by our hands.<br />
b) When we press a rubber ball between our hands, balanced forces acts on it and hence its shape changes.</p>

<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a) When a bus takes a sharp turn, the passengers tend to fall sideways because of their inertia or their tendency to continue moving in a straight line.<br />
b) Road accidents at high speeds are much worse than road accidents at low speeds because the momentum of vehicles at high speeds is very high and causes a lot of damage to the vehicles and injuries to the passengers during collision.</p>

<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 51:<br />
</strong></span>A plastic ball and a clay ball of equal masses, travelling in the same direction with equal speeds, strike against a vertical wall. From which ball does the wall receive a greater amount of momentum ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
The wall will receive equal momentum from both the balls because both balls have equal mass and velocity.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 52:<br />
</strong></span>A moving bicycle comes to rest after sometime if we stop pedalling it. But Newton&8217;s first law of motion says that a moving body should continue to move for ever, unless some external force acts on it. How do you explain the bicycle case ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
In this case, the bicycle has been compelled to change its state of motion by the external force of air resistance and friction. If there were no air resistance and no friction to oppose the motion of the bicycle, then according to the first law of motion, the bicycle would go on moving forever.</p>

</ol>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Mass of ball = 500 g = 0.5 kg<br />
Initial velocity = 10 m/s</p>
<ol>
<li>Initial momentum = 0.5 x 10 = 5 kg.m/s</li>
<li>Velocity at the highest point = 0 m/s</li>
</ol>
<p>Momentum at the highest point = 0.5 x 0 = 0 kg.m/s</p>

<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 20:<br />
</strong></span>Explain how a rocket works<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
A rockets works on the principle of action and reaction. In a rocket, the hot gases produced by the rapid burning of fuel rush out of a jet at the bottom of the rocket at a very high speed. The equal and opposite reaction force of the downward going gases pushes the rocket upward with a great speed.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 21<br />
</strong></span>Do action and reaction act on the same body or different bodies <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">?</span> How are they related in magnitude and direction ? Are they simultaneous or not ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Action and reaction act on two different bodies. Action and reaction are equal in magnitude but they act in opposite directions and there is simultaneous action and reaction.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 22<br />
</strong></span>If a man jumps out from a boat, the boat moves backwards. Why ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
When a man jumps out from a boat, the boat moves backwards due to the fact that to step out of the boat, the man presses the boat with his foot in the backward direction. The push of the man on the boat is action. The boat exerts an equal force on the man in the forward direction and since the boat is not fixed and is floating, it moves backwards due to the action force exerted by the man.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 23<br />
</strong></span>Why is it difficult to walk on a slippery road ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
It becomes very difficult to walk on a slippery road because of the fact that on a slippery road, the friction is much less, and we cannot exert a backward action force on slippery ground which would produce a forward reaction force on us.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 24:<br />
</strong></span>Explain why, a runner presses the ground with his feet before he starts his run.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
To start his run, a runner bends forward and pushes the ground with his feet in the backward direction. In turn ground exerts a reaction force on the runner in the forward direction which makes him run.</p>

<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 35:</strong></span><br />
Name the laws involved in the following situations :<br />
(a) the sum of products of masses and velocities of two moving bodies before and after their collision remains the same.<br />
(b) a body of mass 5 kg can be accelerated more easily by a force than another body of mass 50 kg under similar conditions<br />
(c) when person A standing on roller skates pushes another person B (also standing on roller skates) and makes him move to the right side, then the person A himself gets moved to the left side by an equal distance.<br />
(d) if there were no friction and no air resistance, then a moving bicycle would go on moving for ever.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a)Law of conservation of momentum<br />
b)Newton&8217;s second law of motion<br />
c) Newton&8217;s third law of motion<br />
d)Newton&8217;s first law of motion</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 36:</strong></span><br />
(a) State and explain Newton&8217;s second law of motion.<br />
(b) A 1000 kg vehicle moving with a speed of 20 m/s is brought to rest in a distance of 50 metres :<br />
(i) Find the acceleration.<br />
(ii) Calculate the unbalanced force acting on the vehicle.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) According to Newton&8217;s second law of motion: The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force, and takes place in the direction in which the force acts.<br />
Consider a body of mass m having initial velocity u. the initial momentum of this body will be mu. Suppose a force F acts on this body for time t causing the final velocity to be v. The final momentum of the body will be mv. Now the change in momentum is mv � mu and the time taken for this change is t. So according to Newton&8217;s second law of motion,<br />

<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 37:</strong></span><br />
(a) Explain why, a cricket player moves his hands backwards while catching a fast cricket ball.<br />
(b) A 150 g ball, travelling at 30 m/s, strikes the palm of a player&8217;s hand and is stopped in 0.05 second. Find the force exerted by the ball on the hand.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a) A player moves his hands backwards while catching a fast ball because a fast moving ball has a large momentum and in stopping this ball, its momentum has<br />
to be purpleuced to zero. Now, when a cricket player moves back his hands on catching the fast ball, then the time taken to purpleuce the momentum of the ball is increased. So, the rate of change of momentum of ball is decreased and hence a small force is exerted on the hands of the player and the hands of the player do not get hurt.<br />
b)Mass of ball = 150 g = 0.15 kg<br />
Initial velocity u = 30 m/s<br />
Final velocity v = 0 m/s<br />
Time t = 0.05 s<br />

<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 38:</strong></span><br />
(a) State Newton&8217;s third law of motion and give two examples to illustrate the law.<br />
(b) Explain why, when a fireman directs a powerful stream of water on a fire from a hose pipe, the hose pipe tends to go backward.<br />
<img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4325/36194082596_e1065383ba_o.jpg" alt="lakhmir-singh-physics-class-9-solutions-force-and-laws-of-motion-4" width="360" height="285" /><br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a) According to Newton&8217;s third law of motion: Whenever one body exerts a force on another body, the second body exerts an equal and opposite force on the first body. In other words, to every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Two examples to illustrate this law-<br />
When a man jumps out from a boat, the boat moves backwards. This is due to the fact that to step out of the boat, the man presses the boat with his foot in the backward direction. The push of the man on the boat is action. The boat exerts an equal force in the forward direction and since the boat is not fixed and is floating, it moves backwards due to the action force exerted by the man.<br />
Gunman gets a jerk on firing a bullet from his gun. This is because when a bullet is fipurple from a gun, the force sending the bullet forward is equal to the force sending the gun backwards but due to high mass of the gun, it moves only a little distance backwards giving a jerk to the gunman.<br />
b) When a fireman directs a powerful stream of water on a fire, the hose pipe tends to go backward due to the reaction force of the water rushing through it in the forward direction at a great speed.</p>

<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 39:</strong></span><br />
(a) State the law of conservation of momentum.<br />
(b) Discuss the conservation of momentum in each of the following cases :<br />
(i) a rocket taking off from ground.<br />
(ii) flying of a jet aeroplane.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a) According to the law of conservation of momentum: When two (or more) bodies act upon one another, their total momentum remains constant (or conserved) provided no external forces are acting. It means that when one body gains momentum, then some other body loses an equal amount of momentum i.e. momentum is neither created nor destroyed.<br />
b)<br />
a. Rocket taking off from the ground The chemicals inside the rocket burn and produce very high velocity blast of hot gases. These gases pass out through the tail nozzle of the rocket in the downward direction with tremendous speed and the rocket moves up to balance the momentum of the gases. The gases have a very high velocity ang hence a very large momentum. An equal momentum is imparted to the rocket in the opposite direction, so that it goes up with a high velocity.<br />
b. Flying of jet aeroplane<br />
In jet aeroplanes, a large volume of gases produced by the combustion of fuel is allowed to escape through a jet in backward direction. Due to high velocity, the backward rushing gases have a large momentum. They impart an equal and opposite momentum to the jet aeroplane due to which it moves forward with a great speed.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 40:</strong></span><br />
(a) If a balloon filled with air and its mouth untied/ is released with its mouth in the downward direction, it<br />
moves upwards. Why ?<br />
(b) An unloaded truck weighing 2000 kg has a maximum acceleration of 0.5 m/s<sup>2</sup>. What is the maximum acceleration when it is carrying a load of 2000 kg ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a) If of a balloon filled with compressed air and its mouth untied is released with its mouth in the downward direction, the balloon moves in the upward direction because the air present in the balloon rushes out in the downward direction. The equal and opposite reaction of downward going air pushes the balloon upwards.<br />
b) Mass of the unloaded truck, m<sub>1</sub>= 2000 kg<br />
Acceleration a<sub>1</sub> = 0.5 m/s<sup>2</sup><br />
Mass of loaded truck, m<sub>2</sub> = 2000+ 2000 = 4000 kg<br />
Acceleration a<sub>2</sub><br />
m<sub>1</sub> x a<sub>1</sub> = m<sub>2</sub> x a<sub>2</sub><br />

<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 51:</strong></span><br />
Why are car seat-belts designed to stretch some what in a collision ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Car seat-belts are somewhat stretchable so as to increase the time taken by the passengers to fall forward. Due to this, the rate of change of momentum of passengers is purpleuced and hence less stopping force acts on them. So the passengers do not get hurt.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 52:</strong></span><br />
The troops (soldiers) equipped to be dropped by parachutes from an aircraft are called paratroopers. Why do paratroopers roll on landing ?<br />
<img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4298/35430038623_68445f0dae_o.jpg" alt="lakhmir-singh-physics-class-9-solutions-force-and-laws-of-motion-5" width="401" height="278" /><br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
The paratroopers roll on landing to increase the time taken to purpleuce the momentum of their body. Thus, the rate of change of momentum is purpleuced and hence less force is exerted on their legs and they do not get hurt.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 53:</strong></span><br />
Why would an aircraft be unable to fly on the moon ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
An aircraft needs air because air moving under the wings of aircraft is strong enough to hold it up and air is also requipurple to burn the fuel in aircraft engines. Since there is no air on moon, an aircraft cannot fly on moon.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 54:</strong></span><br />
Explain why it is possible for a small animal to fall from a considerable height without any injury being caused when it reaches the ground.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
It is possible for a small animal to fall from a considerable height without being injupurple because a small animal has small mass, so the momentum produced is less. When the small animal falls to the ground with less momentum, less opposing force of ground acts on it and hence no injury is caused to it</p>

<p><strong>PS Verma and V.K. Agarwal Biology Class 9 Page No &#8211; 165.</strong><br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 1:</span><br />
Importance of tissues-<br />
(i) Formations of tissues have brought about a division of labour in multicellular organisms.<br />
(ii) Tissues become organised to form organs and organs organise into organ system.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 2:</span><br />
Plants are autotrophic organisms, so prepare their own food by photosynthesis. Moreover plants are stationary or fixed organisms; they do not have to move from place to place in the search of their food. Since they do not consume or need much energy, so most of the plant tissues are supportive, which provide them with structural strength. Animals are heterotrophic organisms. They have to move in search of food, mate and find shelter, so they need more energy as compared to plants. Most of the tissues they contain are living.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 3:</span><br />
Plant Tissues<br />
1. They require less maintenance energy.<br />
2. There is a differentiation of meristematic and permanent tissues.<br />
Animal Tissues:<br />
1. They require more maintenance energy.<br />
2. Such a differentiation is absent in them.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 4:</span><br />
They are located at the base of leaves or internodes, e.g., stems of grasses and other monocots. Such tissues also occur below the nodes. It produces an increase in the length of an organ such as leaves and internodes.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 5:</span><br />
(i) Apical meristem &#8211; It brings about the elongation of the root and stem.<br />
(ii) Lateral meristem &#8211; It causes the organ (stem or root) to increase in diameter and girth.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 6:</span><br />
Simple permanent tissues &#8211; These tissues are composed of cells which are structurally and functionally similar.<br />
There are three types of simple permanent tissues:<br />
(i) Parenchyma &#8211; Parenchyma cells are living and posses the power of division. The cell wall is thin and encloses a dense cytoplasm which contains a small nucleus and surrounds a large central vacuole.<br />
(ii) Collenchyma &#8211; Its tissues consists of living cells. It is characterized by the deposition of extra cellulose at the corners of the cells. In collenchymas, intercellular spaces are generally absent. Collenchyma cells are elongated in shape. They often contain a few chloroplasts.<br />
(iii)Sclerenchyma &#8211; Sclerenchyma cells are dead cells and they are devoid of protoplasm. The cells walls of Sclerenchyma are greatly thickened of lignin. The cells of Sclerenchyma are closely packed without intercellular spaces.</p>

The different types of elements present in the phloem are:<br />
(i) Sieve tubes &#8211; Sieve tubes are slender, tube-like structures composed of elongated thin-walled cells, placed end to end. Their end walls are perforated by numerous pores and are called sieve plates.<br />
(ii) Companion Cells &#8211; It is a small thin-walled cell containing dense and very active cytoplasm and large elongated nucleus.<br />
(iii) Phloem parenchyma &#8211; These are thin-walled, living cells of parenchyma of phloem. They have two functions, storage and slow lateral conduction of food.<br />
(iv) Phloem Fibre &#8211; These are thick-walled, elongated spindled shaped dead cells which posses narrow lumen. They provide mechanical strength to the tissue.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 2</span><br />
Tracheary elements are the elements of xylem. Their function is to carry water and mineral salts in upward direction from the roots to different part of shoots.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 3</span><br />

1. The tissue consists of cells having localised thickening in their cell walls.<br />
2. It occurs mostly in the aerial parts of the plants and is restricted to the other layers.<br />
3. Collenchyma is the chief mechanical tissue in parts of a young plant particularly in the young dicotyledonous stems.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 5:</span><br />
Collenchyma:<br />
1. It consists of living cells.<br />
2. Its cells contain cytoplasm.<br />
3. Its cell walls are cellulosic.<br />
Sclerenchyma:<br />

2. Its cells are empty.<br />
3. Its cell walls are lignified.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 6</span><br />
Xylem is composed of cells of four different types: 1. Tracheids; 2. Vessels or tracheae; 3. Xylem parenchyma and 4. Xylem Sclerenchyma. Except xylem parenchyma, all other xylem elements are dead and bounded by thick lignified walls. Vessels are shorter and wider than tracheids. Vessels are very long tube-like structures formed by a row of cells placed end to end. Tracheids are elongated cells with tapering ends. They also conduct water.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 7</span><br />
Functions of Xylem:<br />
(i) The main function of xylem is to carry water and mineral salts upward from the root to different parts of shoots.<br />
(ii) Since walls of tracheids, vessels and sclerenchyma of xylem are lignified, they give mechanical strength to the plant body.<br />

The different tissues in animals are:<br />
(i) Epithelial Tissues &#8211; These are the protective tissues of the animal body. Depending upon the shape and function of the cells, the epithelial tissues are classified as follows:<br />
a. Squamous epithelium.<br />
b. Cuboidal epithelium.<br />
c. Columnar epithelium.<br />
d. Glandular epithelium.<br />
e. Ciliated epithelium.<br />
(ii) Muscular Tissues &#8211; The muscular tissues form the contractile tissues and are made up of muscle cells. On the basis of their location, structure and function, there are three types of muscular tissues:<br />
a. Striated muscles.<br />
b. Smooth muscles.<br />
c. Cardiac muscles.<br />
(iii) Connective Tissues &#8211; The connective tissues are specialised to connect and anchor various body organs. They are of five types:<br />
a. Aerolar connective tissue.<br />
b. Dense regular connective tissue.<br />
c. Adipose tissues.<br />
d. Skeletal tissues.<br />
e. Fluid connective tissues.<br />
(iv) Nervous Tissues &#8211; These tissues are specialised to transmit messages within our body. Brain, spinal cord and nerves are all composed of nervous tissues.<br />

There are three types of simple tissues:<br />
(i) Parenchyma &#8211; Parenchyma cells are living and posses the power of division. The cell wall is thin and encloses a dense cytoplasm which contains a small nucleus and surrounds a large central vacuole.<br />
(ii) Collenchyma &#8211; It tissues also consists of living cells. It is characterized by the deposition of extra cellulose at the corners of the cells. In collenchymas, intercellular spaces are generally absent. Collenchyma cells are elongated in shape. They often contain a few chloroplasts.<br />
(iii) Sclerenchyma &#8211; Sclerenchyma cells are dead cells and they are devoid of protoplasm. The cells walls of Sclerenchyma are greatly thickened by the deposition of lignin. The cells of sclerenchyma are closely packed without intercellular spaces.<br />

According to their position in the plant, meristems are of three types:<br />
a) Apical Meristems &#8211; These are situated at the growing tip of the stems and roots and increase the height of the plant.<br />
b) Lateral Meristems &#8211; These are found beneath the bark and in vascular bundles of dicot roots and stems. These are responsible for the growth of cambium and hence increases the girth of the plant.<br />
c) Intercalary Meristems &#8211; They are located at the base of leaves or internodes or below the nodes. It increases the length of the plant.<br />
