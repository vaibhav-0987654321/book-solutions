Put dried raisins and apricots in pure water and leave them for some time. Then place them into a concentrated Solution of sugar or salt. Each one of them gains water and swells when placed in pure water due to endosmosis. When such swollen raisins/apricots are placed in the concentrated Solution, each of them loses, water, and consequently shrinks again (due to exosmosis).<br />

Endocytosis is the ingestion of material by the cells through the plasma membrane. It is a collective term that describes three similar processes: phagocytosis (cell eating), potocytosis (cell drinking) and receptor-mediated endocytosis. These processes are pathways to specifically internalize solid particles, small molecules ion, and macromolecules, respectively. All of them require energy, so they may be regarded as different forms of active transport.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 12:</span><br />
(i) When eukaryotic cells are placed in hypotonic Solution, the water molecules will enter into the cell and the cell will swell up.<br />
(ii) If eukaryotic cells are placed in hypertonic Solution, the water molecules will come out of the cell and the cell with shrink.<br />
(iii) If the eukaryotic cell is placed in isotonic Solution, the amount of water molecule will remain the same; it will neither move out nor will go inside. The cell will remain same sized.<br />

According to fluid mosaic model, plasma membrane is made up of a bilayer of phospholipids. There are two types of protein molecules: Intrinsic Proteins, which completely covers the lipid bilayer and Extrinsic Proteins, which occur either on the outer surface or on the inner surface of the lipid membrane.<br />
The fluid mosaic membrane has been described as &#8220;a number of protein icebergs floating in the sea of lipids&#8221;.<br />

Nucleus &#8211; The nucleus is a large, centrally located spherical cellular component. It is bounded by two nuclear membranes, both forming a nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm. Within nucleoplasm two types of nuclear structures are embedded &#8211; the nucleolus and chromatin material. The nucleolus may be one or more in number and is not bounded by any membrane. It is rich in protein and RNA molecules and acts as the site for ribosome formation.<br />

(a) Golgi apparatus consists of a set of membrane-bounded, fluid filled vesicles, vacuoles and flattened cisternae. Cisternae are usually stacked together (placed one above the other) in parallel rows. Golgi apparatus exists as an extensive network near the nucleus in the animal cells. However, the plant cells contain many freely distributed subunits of Golgi apparatus, called dictyosomes.<br />
The Golgi apparatus arises from the membrane of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which in turn originates from the rough endoplasmic reticulum.<br />
