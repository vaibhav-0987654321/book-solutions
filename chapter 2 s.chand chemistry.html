According to question-<br />
21.5 g of NaCl dissolves in 60 g of water.<br />
So, amount of NaCl which gets dissolved in 100 g of water = 21.5 x 100 / 60 = 35.8 g<br />
Thus, the solubility of NaCl is 35.8 g at 25oC.<br />

(a). The maximum amount of a solute which can be dissolved in 100 g of a solvent at a specified temperature is known as the solubility of that solute in that solvent .<br />
The solubility of solids in liquids is directly proportional to temperature whereas the solubility of gases in liquids is inversly proportional to temperature.<br />
(b). This statement means that 100 g of water can dissolve a maximum of 20.7 g of copper sulphate at 20oC.<br />
(c). The solubility of solids in liquids increases on increasing the temperature and decreases on decreasing the temperature.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 49</span><br />
(a). A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances.<br />
Example- Salt solution, metal alloys.<br />
(b). A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the small particles of a solid are spread throughout a liquid without dissolving in it.<br />
Example- Muddy-water, Milk of magnesia.<br />
(c). A colloid is a kind of solution in which the size of solute particles is intermediate between those in true solutions and those in suspensions.<br />
Example- Soap solution, milk.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 50</span><br />
(a). A solution in which no more solute can be dissolved at that temperature is called a saturated solution while a solution in which more quantity of solute can be dissolved without raising its temperature is called an unsaturated solution.<br />
To test the saturation or unsaturation of a solution, more solute may be added to the solution. If that solute gets dissolved in the solution then the solution will be unsaturated.<br />
To test whether a given solution is saturated or not, add some more solute to the solution and try to dissolve it by stirring. If solute does not dissolve in the given solution, then it will be a saturated solution.<br />
(b). Take some water in a beaker and heat it slowly with the help of burner. Now, start adding sodium chloride salt to the hot water with a spoon and stir it with a glass rod continuously so that sodium chloride goes on dissolving in water. Take the temperature of water up to 25oC and then keeping this temperature constant, go on adding sodium chloride till no more sodium chloride dissolves in it and some undissolved crystals will be left at the bottom. The contents of the beaker are now filtered and the clear solution obtained is the saturated solution of sodium chloride at 25oC.<br />
If the temperature is lowered from 25oC to 10oC, then some of the crystals of sodium chloride will separate out from the solution in the form of solute crystals.</p>

The mixture of common salt and ammonium chloride is taken in a china dish and placed on a tripod stand. The china dish is covered with an inverted glass funnel. A loose cotton plug is put in the upper, open end of the funnel to prevent the ammonium chloride vapours from escaping into the atmosphere. The china dish is heated by using a burner. On heating the mixture, ammonium chloride changes into white vapours. These vapours rise up and get converted into solid ammonium chloride on coming in contact with the cold, inner walls of the funnel. In this way, pure ammonium chloride collects on the inner sides of the funnel in the form of a sublimate and can be removed. Common salt does not change into vapours on heating, so it remains behind in the china dish and can be separated out.<br />

Ammonium chloride sublimes on heating whereas common salt does not sublime on heating. So, we can separate ammonium chloride from a mixture of common salt and ammonium chloride by the process of sublimation.<br />

A mixture of common salt and water can be separated completely by the process of distillation. The distillation can be used to separate a liquid from dissolved non-volatile solids.<br />
The salt water mixture is taken in the distillation flask A and heated. Some porcelain pieces are put in the distillation flask to avoid bumping of the solution due to uneven heating. On heating, water forms vapours which rise up and come out through the side tube B of the distillation flask, and go into water condenser C. Cold water from tap is circulated through the outer tube of condenser for cooling the vapours. The hot vapours get cooled in the condenser to form pure water (i.e. distilled water) which trickles down from the condenser and collects in the beaker D. Since the salt is non-volatile, so it remains behind in the distillation flask.<br />

In cities, drinking water is supplied from water works where river or lake water is made free from suspended solid substances and germs. In water works, the methods like sedimentation, decantation, loading, filtration and chlorination etc. are used to remove undesirable materials from water. The source of water supply in a city is either a nearby river or lake (reservoir), from there it is pumped into &#8216;sedimentation tank&#8217;. Here it is allowed to stand for sometime so that many of insoluble substances present in water settle down at bottom of the tank. From there, it is sent to a &#8216;loading tank&#8217; where some alum is added to water. Here suspended clay particles in water get loaded with alum particles, become heavy and settle down at the bottom of the tank. Then, it is passed through &#8216;filtration tank&#8217;. It has three layers: fine sand layer at top, coarse sand layer in middle and gravel as the bottom layer. These act as filters and even the small suspended particles get removed when water passes through these layers. Then, the clear water is passed into a chlorination tank. Here, chlorine is added to water to kill the germs present in it. Now, the clean and disinfected water is pumped by pumping station into high storage tanks and from there, it is supplied to homes and factories through the network of big and small pipes.<br />

(a) Fractional distillation is the process of separating two or more miscible liquids (liquids which mix together in all proportions and form a single layer) by distillation, the distillate being collected in fractions boiling at different temperatures. The separation of two liquids by fractional distillation depends on the difference in their boiling points. It is carried out by using a fractionating column.<br />
Fractionating column is a long vertical glass tube filled with glass beads. The glass beads provide a large surface area for hot vapours to cool and condens repeatedly. It provides different temperature zones inside it, the highest temperature being at the bottom of the column and the lowest temperature near its top. It is fitted in the neck of the distillation flask.<br />

(a)Air is mixture of gases like nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, helium, neon, krypton, xeon etc. The various gases of air are separated from one another by fractional distillation of liquid air. This separation is based on the fact that different gases of air have different boiling points(in liquid form).<br />
The air is first filtered to remove dust, then water vapour and carbon dioxide are removed. Air is compressed to a high pressure and then cooled. The cooled air is then allowed to expand quickly into a chamber through a jet. This cools the air even more. This process of compression, cooling and rapid expansion of air is repeated again and again to make the air more and more cool so that it becomes liquid air. Now, the liquid air is fed into a tall fractionating column and warmed up slowly.<br />
Liquid nitrogen has lowest boiling point of -196oC.So, on warming, it boils off first to form nitrogen gas and is collected at the upper part of the fractional distillation column. Liquid argon has a slightly higher boiling point of -186oC. So, it boils off next and collected as argon gas in the middle part of fractional distillation column. Liquid oxygen has a still higher boiling point of -183 oC. So, liquid oxygen boils off last and collected as oxygen gas at the bottom of fractional distillation column.<br />
