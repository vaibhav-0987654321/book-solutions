<strong><span style="color: #00bdeb;">CBSE Class 9 Chapter 4 Diversity In Living Organisms</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 1</span><br />
(a) Point Diversity &#8211; This is a diversity present on the smallest scale.<br />
(b) Alpha Diversity &#8211; Also known as local diversity and includes variety of organisms local to a particular habitat.<br />
(c) Gamma Diversity &#8211; It represents the diversity of a larger unit such as an island or a landscape.<br />
(d) Epsilon Diversity &#8211; It is also called regional diversity and includes total diversity of a group of gamma diversity areas.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 2</span><br />
A single plant may be considered as a unit of alpha diversity; a leaf as an area of point diversity; a group of plants occurring together as an area of gamma diversity and the forest within which the plants are located as an area of epsilon diversity.<br />

Classification is essential to understand the inter-relationship among different groups of organisms.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 4</span><br />
The basis of classification is to study the diversity among living organisms in an effective way.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 5</span><br />
There are two broad categories of cell structure: Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic. Thus, two broad groups can be formed &#8211; one having prokaryotic cell structure and the other having eukaryotic cell structure.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 6</span><br />
Seven categories of hierarchical classification are: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus and Species.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 7</span><br />
Features of plants:<br />
(a) The growth of plant body is often unlimited and continues till death.<br />
(b) The asexual reproduction or vegetative reproduction is common in the plants.<br />
Features of animals:<br />
(a) They have definite shape and size.<br />
(b) Animals have distinct excretory organs.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 8</span><br />
The two kingdom system of classification was not found to be suitable to many scientists due to large diversity among the organisms and many other limitations. The main demerits of the system are &#8211;<br />
(i) Many protozoans possess characters of both plants and animals. For example, Euglena has animal characters but it contains chlorophyll.<br />
(ii) Bacteria and Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) have many similarities between them and are quite different from other organisms. Thus, it is difficult to place them in their plant or animal kingdom.<br />

Protochordata is one of the groups of phylum chordata. Protochordata constitutes the marine, small, primitive, or lower chordates. The members of protochordates lack a head, skull or cranium, vertebral column and brain. About 2000 species are found in this group. This is further divided into three subphylum: Hemichordata (e.g. Balanoglossus ), Urochordata (e.g. Herdmania) and Cephalochordata (e.g. Branchiostoma) based on the position of notochord.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution SAQ &#8211; 48</span><br />

Notochord is a transient mesodermal rod in the most dorsal portion of the chordate embryo. In other words, notochord is an ensheathed flexible rod of turgid cells located along the back of chordate embryos and some primitive chordates ventral to nerve cord. It provides place for the attachment of muscles. Notochord has given rise to jointed axial skeleton of vertebral column.<br />
Nerve cord is a collection of nerve fibres that runs throughout the length of an animal. It is hollow and dorsal in chordates where it gets modified into central nervous system of brain and spinal cord. Nerve cord is solid and ventral in nonchordates.<br />

The Linnaean system of classification consists of a hierarchy of graded taxonomic (named) ranks that are called as taxa. Any given taxon (singular) may contain several lower taxa, which can be usually distinguished based on certain common characteristics. Such lower ranks may in turn be divided into a succession of progressively smaller ranks. The lower the rank of a group, the more similar are the organisms grouped in it. If any two given organisms can be grouped under the same lower rank or taxon, it implies that the two organisms are structurally, functionally, embryologically similar and that they have had a comparable evolutionary history.<br />
Within the living world as a whole, the biggest taxonomic rank is Kingdom. The next higher rank within a kingdom is the Phylum or Division. It is customary to use the term phylum for major groups in the animal kingdom and the term division for major groups in the plant kingdom. The phylum or division is a broad grouping of more or less closely related organisms, sharing certain common characteristics.<br />
Each phylum or division has the next taxon called Class. The members of each class exhibit certain distinguishing characters that are unique only to them.<br />
In the same way, using comparable criteria of similarities and relationships, each class can be divided into orders, each order into families, each family into genera and each genus into species. Species is normally the basic or fundamental unit of classification. A species is therefore the narrowest taxonomic category and kingdom is the broadest category in the Linnaean hierarchy.<br />
A typical Linnaean hierarchy has seven taxa represented as follows:<br />

Importance of classification:<br />
(i) It makes the study of such a wide variety of organisms easy.<br />
(ii) It projects before us a good picture of all life forms at a glance.<br />
(iii) It helps us understand the interrelationship among different groups of organisms.<br />
(iv) It serves as a base for the development of other biological sciences such as biogeography etc.<br />
(v) Various fields of applied biology such as agriculture, public health and environmental biology depends on classification of pests, disease vectors, pathogens and components of an ecosystem.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 3</span><br />
Hierarchy is defined as sequence of categories in a decreasing or increasing order from kingdom to species and vice versa. Kingdom is the highest rank followed by division, class, order, family, genus and species. Species is the lowest rank in the hierarchy. The hierarchy has two categories which are obligate and intermediate. Obligate means they are followed strictly and range from kingdom to species as said above. Intermediate are not followed strictly and they are added in obligate list such as subdivision, super family, super class, suborder, subspecies etc.;<br />
(i) Species: Group of population which is similar in form, shape and reproductive features so that fertile sibling can be produced. Some siblings can be sterile when a hybrid is produced. A hybrid can be product of female horse and male donkey (Mule). Sexual reproduction is present in eukaryotes. Species is followed by subspecies, varieties and races. These categories are inferior as compared to species.<br />
(ii) Genus: It is defined as group of similar species. But it is not mandatory to have many species. Some genera have only one species known as monotypic. If there are more than one species it is known as polytypic. For example lion, tiger are quite similar species placed under the genus Panthera.<br />
(iii) Family: It is defined as collection of similar genera. It can be separated from genera by reproductive and vegetative features. For example, cats and leopard are included in the family Felidae.<br />
(iv) Order: One or more than one similar families constitute order. Family Felidae are included in the order Carnivora.<br />
(v) Class: One or more than one order makes a class. Class Mammalia includes all mammals which are bats, rodents, kangaroos, whales, great apes and man.<br />
(vi) Phylum: It is a term used for animals while its synonym division is used for plants. It is a collection of similar classes. Phylum chordata of animals has class Mammalia along with birds, reptiles and amphibians.<br />
(vii) Kingdom: The top most taxonomic category. Example all animals are included in Kingdom Animalia. The unit in classification that denotes grouping of organism based on features which are observable is known as Taxon.<br />

Kingdom Monera is the first of the five kingdoms of biological classification. It comprised most organisms with a prokaryotic cell organization. For this reason the kingdom was sometimes called Prokaryota or Prokaryotae. Prior to its creation these were treated as two separate divisions of plants: the Schizomycetes (bacteria) were considered fungi, and the Cyanophyta were considered blue-green algae. The latter are now considered a group of bacteria, typically called the cyanobacteria.<br />
Monera has been divided into Archaea and Bacteria, forming the more recent six-kingdom system and three-domain system. All new schemes abandon the Monera and now treat the Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya as separate domains or kingdoms. To sum up:<br />
(i) Kingdom Monera are one-celled without an organized nucleus. Examples: bacteria and blue-green &#8220;algae.&#8221;<br />
(ii) They have existed on earth longer and are more widely distributed than any other organisms.<br />
(iii) They are found in almost every imaginable habitat; in air, soil, and water and in extreme temperatures and harsh chemical environments.<br />
(iv) Their one distinguishing characteristic is that there are no membrane bound &#8220;organelles&#8221;.<br />

Characteristics of Kingdom Fungi:<br />
(i) Simple non-green plants which are not photosynthetic. They are heterotrophic and eukaryotic organisms. Some fungi, such as Puccinia, Albugo etc are parasites and draw their nutrients from living cells of their host plants. Some fungi, such as Mucor, Rhizopus etc are decomposers, deriving their nutrition from dead remains of plants and animals.<br />
(ii) They may be unicellular (yeast) or filamentous (most fungi). The body of a multicellular and filamentous fungus is called a mycelium and is composed of several thread like structures termed hyphae.<br />
(iii) Fungi have a cell wall containing a mixture of chitin and cellulose. Chitin is a tough complex sugar.<br />
(iv) Their reserve food material is glycogen.<br />

The division Spermatophyta (sperma = seed, phyton = plant), as the name suggests, includes all seed bearing plants. It has been divided into two sub divisions- Gymnosperms and Angiosperms. The sub-division Gymnosperms (gymno = naked, sperma = seed) includes simpler and primitive plants of the division Spermatophyta.<br />
Gymnosperms: The gymnosperms are seed producing land plants. However, the seeds are not enclosed in fruits. Most of them have now become extinct and only about 900 species are known to be surviving. The living gymnosperms are widely distributed in the cold climates where snow, rather than rain, is the source of water. Only one group called cycads thrive in warmer regions. Example: Pinus.<br />
Angiosperms: Angiosperms represent the most advanced group of vascular plants. They are commonly called &#8216;Flowering plants&#8217;. They exceed all other major groups of living plants in number and diversity.<br />
Example: Sunflower<br />
