<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 38</span></strong><br />
Velocity of sound = Frequency x wavelength<br />
Speed of sound in air is constant.<br />
Hence, frequency x wavelength = constant<br />
If frequency is doubled, wavelength is reduced to half.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 39</span></strong><br />
The frequency in hertz is equal to the number of waves produced per second. In this case, 20 waves are produced per second, so the frequency of sound waves is 20 hertz.<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 41</span></strong><br />
Vacuum means empty space, region with no matter particles. Sound cannot travel through vacuum because vacuum has no molecules which can vibrate and carry sound waves.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 42</span></strong><br />
The maximum displacement of the particles of the medium from their original undisturbed positions, when a wave passes through the medium, is called amplitude (A) of the wave.<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 43</span></strong><br />
(a) A wave in which the particles of the medium vibrate back and forth in the &#8216;same direction&#8217;, in which the wave is moving, is called a longitudinal wave. These<br />
waves can be produced in all the three media: solids, liquids and gases. A wave in which the particles of the medium vibrate up and down, &#8216;at right angles&#8217;<br />
to the direction in which the wave is moving, is called a transverse wave. It can be produced in solids and liquids but not in gases.<br />
(b) Sound is a longitudinal wave.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 44</span></strong><br />
Due to the very high speed of light we see the ball hitting the bat first. And it is due to comparatively lower speed of sound that the sound of hitting is heard a little later.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 45</span></strong><br />
Light travels much faster than sound. Due to this, the flash of lightning is seen first and the sound of thunder is heard a little later.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 46</span></strong><br />
Light travels much faster than sound. Due to this, the flash of gun shot is seen first and the sound of gun shot is heard a little later.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 47</span></strong><br />
Sound waves in air: Longitudinal, Compression, Rarefaction<br />
Water waves: Transverse, Crest, Trough<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 48</span></strong><br />
(a) Sound can be produced by the following methods:<br />
(i) By vibrating strings (as in a sitar),<br />
(ii) By vibrating air (as in a flute),<br />
(iii) By vibrating membranes (as in a drum)<br />
(iv) By vibrating plates (as in cymbals)<br />
(b) Speed of sound wave= frequency x wavelength<br />
<img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7645/16766454919_0724f84560_o.png" alt="s-chand-class-9-physics-solutions-chapter-5-Sound-Q48" width="293" height="126" /><br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 49</span></strong><br />
This is due to the fact that when the ringing bell is held tightly with our hand, it stops vibrating and the sound coming from it also stops.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 50</span></strong><br />
Sound is produced by the following objects:<br />
(i) Vibrating stretched strings of sitar<br />
(ii) Vibrating stretched membranes of tabla<br />
(iii) Vibrating prongs of a tuning fork<br />
(iv) Vibrating wings of mosquito<br />
(v) Vibrating air columns in flute.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 51</span></strong><br />
In most of the cases, a sound producing object vibrates so fast that we cannot see its vibrations with our eyes. The time inetrval between two successive vibration is lower than the persistence of vision. Hence we see the object in static state and not in vibration mode.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 52</span></strong><br />
Fill water in a beaker up to its brim. Touch the surface of water with the prongs of a sound making tuning fork (which has been struck on a hard rubber pad). The prongs of tuning fork producing sound splash water. This shows that the prongs of a sound producing tuning fork are vibrating (moving forwards and backwards rapidly).<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 53</span></strong><br />
The sound of a gas travels through the vibrations of air layers so it reaches first, but the smell of gas reaches the person through the actual movement of the air<br />
layers, which takes more time.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 54</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 56</span></strong><br />
The number of complete waves (or cycles) produced in one second is called frequency of the wave.<br />
The time required to produce one complete wave (or cycle) is called time-period of the wave.<br />
The time taken to complete one vibration is called time-period.<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 57</span></strong><br />
A ringing bell suspended in a vacuum chamber cannot be heard outside because sound cannot travel through vacuum as it has no molecules which can vibrate and carry<br />
sound waves.<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 59</span></strong><br />
A compression is that part of a longitudinal wave in which the particles of the medium are closer to one another than they normally are, and there is a momentary reduction in volume of the medium. It is a region of high pressure.<br />
A rarefaction is that part of a longitudinal wave in which the particles of the medium are farther apart than normal, and there is a momentary increase in the volume of the medium. It is a region of low pressure.<br />

<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 60</span></strong><br />
(a) Sound is that form of energy which makes us hear. Sound waves are longitudinal waves in air.<br />
(b) Sound cannot travel through vacuum. This can be shown by the following experiment:<br />
(i) A ringing electric bell is placed inside an air tight glass jar containing air. We can hear the sound of ringing bell clearly. Thus, when air is present as medium in the bell jar, sound can travel through it and reach our ears.<br />
(ii) The bell jar containing ringing bell is placed over the plate of a vacuum pump. Air is gradually removed from the bell jar by switching on the vacuum pump. As more and more air is removed from the bell jar, the sound of ringing bell becomes fainter and fainter. And when all the air is removed from the bell jar, no sound can be heard at all. Thus, when vacuum is created in the bell jar, then the sound of ringing bell placed inside it cannot be heard.<br />
This shows that sound cannot travel through vacuum.<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 61</span></strong><br />
(a) Sound is produced when an object vibrates. For example, the sound of our voice is produced by the vibrations of two vocal cords in our throat caused by air coming from the lungs.<br />
(b) When an object vibrates (and makes sound), then the air layers around it also start vibrating in exactly the same way and carry sound waves from the sound producing object to our ears.<br />
Suppose a tuning fork is vibrating and producing sound waves in air. Since the prongs of the tuning fork are vibrating, the individual layers of air are also vibrating. Sound travels in the form of longitudinal waves in which the back and forth vibrations of the air layers are in the same direction as the movement of sound wave.<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 62</span></strong><br />
(a) If the air is gradually pumped out of the glass vessel, no sound of the electric bell can be heard because vacuum is created in the vessel and there are no air molecules to carry sound vibrations.<br />
(b) Sound cannot be heard on the surface of moon because there is no air on the moon to carry the sound waves.<br />
Astronauts talk to one another on the surface of moon through wireless sets using radio waves. This is because radio waves can travel even through vacuum though sound waves cannot travel through vacuum.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 63</span></strong><br />
(a) The number of vibrations per second is called frequency.<br />
The minimum distance in which a sound wave repeats itself is called its wavelength.<br />
The distance travelled by a wave in one second is called velocity of wave.<br />
Relation between velocity, frequency and wavelength of a wave:<br />
Velocity of wave= frequency x wavelength<br />

(i) The waves which travel along a spring when it is pushed and pulled at one end.<br />
(ii) Sound waves in air Transverse waves:<br />
(i) The waves produced by moving one end of a long spring up and down rapidly, while other end is fixed.<br />
(ii) The water waves or ripples formed on the surface of water in a pond.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 65</span></strong><br />
(a) A compression is that part of a longitudinal wave in which the particles of the medium are closer to one another than they normally are, and there is a momentary reduction in volume of the medium.<br />
A rarefaction is that part of a longitudinal wave in which the particles of the medium are farther apart than normal, and there is a momentary increase in the volume of the medium.<br />
Longitudinal waves consist of compressions and rarefactions.<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 66</span></strong><br />
(a) The &#8216;elevation&#8217; or &#8216;hump&#8217; in a transverse wave is called crest. It is that part of the transverse wave which is above the line of zero disturbance of the medium. The &#8216;depression&#8217; or &#8216;hollow&#8217; in a transverse wave is called trough. It is that part of the transverse wave which is below the line of zero disturbance of medium. A ransverse wave consists of crests and troughs.<br />
(b) Speed of sound= 332m/s<br />
Time =3 sec<br />

<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 67</span></strong><br />
(a) When we put our ear to a railway line, we can hear the sound of an approaching train even when the train is far off but its sound cannot be heard through the air. This is due to the fact that sound travels much more fast through the railway line made of steel than through air.<br />
(b) There is no actual movement of air from the sound-producing body to our ear. The air layers only vibrate back and forth, and transfer the sound energy from one layer to the next layer till it reaches our ear.<br />
This will be clear from an example: If we turn on a gas tap for a few seconds, a person standing a few metres away will hear the sound of escaping gas first and the smell of gas reaches him afterwards. The sound of gas travels through the vibrations of air layers so it reaches first, but the smell of gas reaches the person through the actual movement of the air layers, which takes more time. So, it is clear that the sound is not being transmitted by the actual movement of air from the gas tap to person, otherwise he would hear and smell the gas at the same time.</p>

The persistence of sound in a big hall due to repeated reflections from the walls, ceiling and floor of the hall is called reverberation. If the reverberation time in a big hall is too long, then the sound becomes blurred, distorted and confusing due to overlapping.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 41</span></strong><br />
Reverberations in a big hall or auditorium can be reduced by the following methods :<br />
i) Panels made of sound absorbing materials are put on the walls and ceilings of hall and auditorium.<br />
ii) Carpets are put on the floor to absorb sound and reduce reverberations<br />
iii) Heavy curtains are put on doors and windows to absorb sound and reduce reverberations<br />
iv) The seats in the hall are made from materials having sound absorbing properties<br />
<strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">solution 42</span></strong><br />
We hear more clearly in a room with curtains than in a room without curtains because curtains are bad reflectors of sound. They absorb most of the sound falling on them, and hence do not produce echoes. On the other hand, in rooms without curtains, there is a greater reflection of sound due to which some echoes are produced.<br />
These echoes cause a hindrance to hearing.<br />

The soundboard is a concave board (curved board) which is placed behind the speaker in large halls or auditoriums so that his speech can be easily heard even by the persons sitting at a considerable distance. The sound board works as follows: the speaker is made to stand at the focus of the concave soundboard. The concave surface of the soundboard reflects the sound waves of the speaker towards the audience (and hence prevents the spreading of sound in various directions). Due to this, sound is distributed uniformly throughout the hall and even the persons sitting at the back of the hall can hear the speech easily.<br />

When we strike a table lightly, then due to less energy supplied, the table top vibrates with a small amplitude and hence a soft sound is produced. However if we hit the table hard, due to greater energy supplied, the table top vibrates with a large amplitude and hence a loud sound is produced.<br />

Construction of human ear:<br />
The ear consists of three compartments: outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The outer ear consists of broad part called pinna and about 2 to 3 centimeters long passage called ear canal. At the end of ear canal is a thin, elastic, circular membrane called tympanum or ear-drum. The middle ear contains three small delicate bones called hammer, anvil and stirrup. These bones are linked to one another. The one end of hammer is touching the ear drum and its other end is connected to the second bone called anvil. The other end of anvil is connected to the third bone called stirrup. And the free end of stirrup is held against the membrane over the oval window of the inner ear. The lower part of middle ear has Eustachian tube going to the throat. The inner ear has a coiled structure called cochlea. The cochlea is filled with liquid containing sound sensitive nerve cells. The other side of cochlea is connected to the auditory nerve which goes to the brain.<br />
Working of human ear:<br />
The sound waves are collected by the pinna. These sound waves pass through ear canal and fall on the ear-drum. Sound waves consist of compressions and rarefactions. When the compression strikes the ear drum, the pressure on the outside of ear drum increases and pushes the ear drum inwards. And when rarefaction strikes the ear drum, the pressure on the outside of ear drum decreases and it moves outwards. Thus, when sound waves fall on the ear drum, it vibrates back and forth rapidly. These vibrations are passed onto the three bones in the middle ear and finally to the liquid in the cochlea. Due to this, liquid in the cochlea starts to vibrate, setting up electrical impulses in the nerve cells present in it. These impulses are carried to the brain by auditory nerve. The brain interprets the impulses and we get the sensation of hearing.</p>
