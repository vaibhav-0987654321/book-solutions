<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 55</span><br />
(a). The stream of particles coming out from cathode (negative electrode) are called cathode rays. Cathode rays are negatively charged.<br />
(b). When electricity at high voltage is passed through a gas at very low pressure taken in discharge tube, stream of minute particles are given out by the cathode. These stream of particles are called cathode rays.<br />
(c). The conclusion is that all the atoms contain negatively charged particles called electrons.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 56</span><br />

2. The nucleus is surrounded by negatively charged electrons. The electrons are revolving at very high speed round the nucleus in fixed circular orbits.<br />
3. The electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nucleus and negatively charged electrons keep the atom held together.<br />
4. An atom is electrically neutral.<br />

3. Electrons revolve round the nucleus in fixed circular orbits.<br />
4. Maximum no. of electrons for any given shell is fixed. Any shell cannot exceed that maximum value.<br />
5. Each given shell is associated with fixed amount of energy.<br />
6. There is no change in energy of electrons as long as they keep revolving in the same energy level, and the atom remains stable.<br />

<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 22</span><br />
The difference in the masses of isotopes of an element is due to different number of neutrons in their nuclei.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 23</span><br />
Because all the isotopes of an element have identical atomic configuration containing same number of valence electrons, therefore, all the isotopes of an element show identical chemical properties.<br />
For example- Cl-35 and Cl-37, show identical chemical properties as they have same no. of 7 valence electrons.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 24</span><br />
Due to slight difference in the masses of the isotopes of an element, the physical properties of the isotopes are slightly different.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 25</span><br />
The fractional atomic masses of elements are due to the existence of their isotopes having different masses.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 26</span><br />
Deuterium, Protium and Tritium are isotopes.<br />
Argon and Calcium are isobars.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 27</span><br />
(i). Due to identical electronic configuration containing the same no. of valence electrons, these isotopes have almost identical chemical properties.<br />
(ii). All of them have 1 electron and 1 proton, so, they are electrically neutral.<br />

(a).The isotopes which are unstable due to presence of extra neutrons in their nuclei and emit various types of radiations, are called radioactive isotopes or radioisotopes.<br />
For example: Carbon &#8211; 14 , Arsenic &#8211; 74<br />
(b). Uses of isotopes-<br />
(i). They are used in the treatment of cancer.<br />
(ii). Radioactive isotopes are used as &#8216;tracers&#8217; in medicine to detect the presence of tumors and blood clots in human body.<br />

<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 35</span><br />
(a). The capacity of an atom of an element to form chemical bonds is known as its valency.<br />
Valency of an atom with atomic no. 14 is 4.<br />
(b). The valency of an element is either equal to the number of valence electrons in its atom or equal to the number of electrons required to complete eight electrons in the valence shell.<br />
Valency of metal = No. of valence electron in its atom<br />
Valency of a non-metal = 8 &#8211; No. of valence electron in its atom<br />
For example- Valency of sodium (metal) is 1 and that of chlorine (non-metal) is also 1.</p>
