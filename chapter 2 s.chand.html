<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 26:</strong></span><br />
Which of the two, balanced forces or unbalanced forces, can change the shape of an object ? Give an example to illustrate your solution.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Balanced forces can change the shape of the object. For example, when a balloon is pressed between hands, then balanced forces (equal and opposite forces) act on the balloon due to which the shape of the balloon changes.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 27:</strong></span><br />
Describe the term &8216;inertia&8217; with respect to motion.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Inertia of motion is the property of a body due to which it resists a change in its state of uniform motion. For eg., if there is no air resistance and no friction to oppose the motion of a moving bicycle, it will go on moving forever.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 28:</strong></span><br />
State Newton&8217;s first law of motion. Give two examples to illustrate Newton&8217;s first law of motion.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Newton&8217;s first law of motion states that a body at rest will remain at rest, and a body in motion will continue in motion in a straight line with a uniform speed unless it is compelled by an external force to change its state of rest or of uniform motion. For example, a book lying on a table remains on the table unless we lift it with the force of our hands. And, on a frictionless surface, a moving car continues to be in the state of motion until brakes are applied on it.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 29:</strong></span><br />
On what factor does the inertia of a body depend ? Which has more inertia, a cricket ball or a rubber ball of the same size ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Inertia of a body depends on its mass. A cricket ball has more inertia than a rubber ball of the same size because it has more mass than the rubber ball.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 30:</strong></span><br />
Why do the passengers in a bus tend to fall backward when it starts suddenly ?<br />
<span style="color:purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
When a bus starts suddenly, its passengers tend to fall backwards because due to their inertia, the passengers tend to remain in a state of rest even when the bus starts moving.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 31:</strong></span><br />
Explain why, a person travelling in a bus falls forward when the bus stops suddenly.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
When a bus stops suddenly, its passengers tend to fall forward because due to their inertia, the passengers tend to remain in a state of motion even though the bus has come to rest.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 32:</strong></span><br />
Give reason for the following :<br />
When a hanging carpet is beaten with a stick, the dust particles start coming out of it.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
When a hanging carpet is beaten with a stick, the carpet moves to and fro with the force of the stick while the dust particles remain in their state of rest on account of their inertia and thus dust particles separate out from the carpet.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 33:</strong></span><br />
When a tree is shaken, its fruits and leaves fall down: Why ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
When a tree is shaken, the tree moves to and fro while the fruits and leaves remain in their state of rest on account of their inertia and thus fruits and leaves separate from the tree and fall from the tree.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 34:</strong></span><br />
Explain why, it is dangerous to jump out of a moving bus.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
It is dangerous to jump out of a moving bus because the jumping man, who is moving with the high speed of the bus would tend to remain in state of motion due to inertia even on falling to the ground and get hurt due to resistance offepurple by the ground.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 35:</strong></span><br />
What is the momentum in kg.m/s of a 10 kg car travelling at (a) 5 m/s (b) 20 cm/s, and (c) 36 km/h ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Mass of car, m = 10 kg<br />
Momentum = m x v<br />
a) Velocity, v = 5 m/s Momentum = 10 x 5 = 50 kg.m/s<br />
b) Velocity, v = 20 cm/s = 0.2 m/s Momentum = 10 x 0.2 = 2 kg.m/s<br />
c) Velocity, v = 36km/hr = 10 m/s Momentum = 10 x 10 = 100 kg.m/s</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 36:</strong></span><br />
(a) Define momentum of a body. On what factors does the momentum of a body depend ?<br />
(b) Calculate the change in momentum of a body weighing 5 kg when its velocity decreases from 20 m/s to 0.20 m/s.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a) Momentum is the physical quantity which is the measure of the quantity of motion of a moving body. It depends on mass and velocity of the body.<br />
b) Mass of body = 5 kg<br />
Velocity v<sub>1</sub> = 20 m/s<br />
Momentum p<sub>1</sub> = 20 x 5 = 100 kg.m/s<br />
Velocity v<sub>2</sub> = 0.2 m/s<br />
Momentum p<sub>2</sub> = 5 x 0.2 = 1 kg.m/s<br />
Change in momentum = p<sub>2</sub>&8211; p<sub>1</sub>= 1-100 = -99 kg.m/s (Negative sign shows that momentum decreases)</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 37:</strong></span><br />
(a) Define the term &8216;force&8217;.<br />
(b) State the various effects of force.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a) Force is an influence which tends to set a stationary body in motion or stop a moving body; or which tends to change the speed and direction of a moving body; or which tends to change the shape and size of a body.<br />
b) Various effects of force are<br />
i) A force can move a stationary body.<br />
ii) A force can stop a moving body.<br />
iii) A force can change the speed of a moving body.<br />
iv) A force can change the direction of a moving body.<br />
v) A force can change the shape and size of a body.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 38:</strong></span><br />
Give one example each where :<br />
(a) a force moves a stationary body.<br />
(b) a force stops a moving body.<br />
(c) a force changes the speed of a moving body.<br />
(d) a force changes the direction of a moving body.<br />
(e) a force changes the shape (and size) of a body.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a) Kicking a stationary football.<br />
b) Applying brakes to a moving bicycle.<br />
c) Pressing an accelerator to speed up a moving car.<br />
d) A moving cricket ball hit by a bat.<br />
e) Flattening of dough by a rolling pin to make chapatis.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 39:</strong></span><br />
(a) What do you understand by the terms &8220;balanced forces&8221; and &8220;unbalanced forces&8221; ? Explain with examples.<br />
(b) What type of forces &8211; balanced or unbalanced &8211; act on a rubber ball when we press it between our hands ? What effect is produced in the ball ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a) If the resultant of all the forces acting on a body is zero, the forces are called balanced forces. These forces do not change the state of rest or of uniform motion of a body but can change the shape of the body. For example, when a balloon is pressed between hands, then balanced forces (equal and opposite forces) act on the balloon due to which the shape of the balloon changes.<br />
If the resultant of all the forces acting on a body is not zero, the forces are called unbalanced forces. These forces change the state of rest or of uniform motion of a body. For eg., if we push a toy car lying on the ground, it starts moving due to the unbalanced force exerted by our hands.<br />
b) When we press a rubber ball between our hands, balanced forces acts on it and hence its shape changes.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 40:</strong></span><br />
(a) What happens to the passengers travelling in a bus when the bus takes a sharp turn ? Give reasons for<br />
your solution.<br />
(b) Why are road accidents at high speeds very much worse than road accidents at low speeds ?<br />
<img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4320/35400371334_0bc6db2904_o.jpg" alt="lakhmir-singh-physics-class-9-solutions-force-and-laws-of-motion-2" width="844" height="304" /><br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a) When a bus takes a sharp turn, the passengers tend to fall sideways because of their inertia or their tendency to continue moving in a straight line.<br />
b) Road accidents at high speeds are much worse than road accidents at low speeds because the momentum of vehicles at high speeds is very high and causes a lot of damage to the vehicles and injuries to the passengers during collision.</p>

<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 51:<br />
</strong></span>A plastic ball and a clay ball of equal masses, travelling in the same direction with equal speeds, strike against a vertical wall. From which ball does the wall receive a greater amount of momentum ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
The wall will receive equal momentum from both the balls because both balls have equal mass and velocity.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 52:<br />
</strong></span>A moving bicycle comes to rest after sometime if we stop pedalling it. But Newton&8217;s first law of motion says that a moving body should continue to move for ever, unless some external force acts on it. How do you explain the bicycle case ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
In this case, the bicycle has been compelled to change its state of motion by the external force of air resistance and friction. If there were no air resistance and no friction to oppose the motion of the bicycle, then according to the first law of motion, the bicycle would go on moving forever.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 53:<br />
</strong></span>A man throws a ball weighing 500 g vertically upwards with a speed of 10 m/s.</p>
<ol>
<li>What will be its initial momentum ?</li>
<li>What would be its momentum at the highest point of its flight ?</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Mass of ball = 500 g = 0.5 kg<br />
Initial velocity = 10 m/s</p>
<ol>
<li>Initial momentum = 0.5 x 10 = 5 kg.m/s</li>
<li>Velocity at the highest point = 0 m/s</li>
</ol>
<p>Momentum at the highest point = 0.5 x 0 = 0 kg.m/s</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 54:<br />
</strong></span>A car is moving on a level road. If the driver turns off the engine of the car, the car&8217;s speed decreases gradually and ultimately it comes to a stop. A student says that two forces act on the car which bring it to a stop. What could these forces be ? Which of these two forces contributes more to slow down and stop the car ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
The two forces acting on the car are force of friction and air resistance. Force of friction contributes more to slow down and stop the car.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 55:<br />
</strong></span>There are two types of forces X and Y. The forces belonging to type X can produce motion in a stationary object but cannot change the shape of the object.

<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 20:<br />
</strong></span>Explain how a rocket works<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
A rockets works on the principle of action and reaction. In a rocket, the hot gases produced by the rapid burning of fuel rush out of a jet at the bottom of the rocket at a very high speed. The equal and opposite reaction force of the downward going gases pushes the rocket upward with a great speed.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 21<br />
</strong></span>Do action and reaction act on the same body or different bodies <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">?</span> How are they related in magnitude and direction ? Are they simultaneous or not ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Action and reaction act on two different bodies. Action and reaction are equal in magnitude but they act in opposite directions and there is simultaneous action and reaction.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 22<br />
</strong></span>If a man jumps out from a boat, the boat moves backwards. Why ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
When a man jumps out from a boat, the boat moves backwards due to the fact that to step out of the boat, the man presses the boat with his foot in the backward direction. The push of the man on the boat is action. The boat exerts an equal force on the man in the forward direction and since the boat is not fixed and is floating, it moves backwards due to the action force exerted by the man.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 23<br />
</strong></span>Why is it difficult to walk on a slippery road ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
It becomes very difficult to walk on a slippery road because of the fact that on a slippery road, the friction is much less, and we cannot exert a backward action force on slippery ground which would produce a forward reaction force on us.</p>

(a) Explain why, a cricket player moves his hands backwards while catching a fast cricket ball.<br />
(b) A 150 g ball, travelling at 30 m/s, strikes the palm of a player&8217;s hand and is stopped in 0.05 second. Find the force exerted by the ball on the hand.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a) A player moves his hands backwards while catching a fast ball because a fast moving ball has a large momentum and in stopping this ball, its momentum has<br />
to be purpleuced to zero. Now, when a cricket player moves back his hands on catching the fast ball, then the time taken to purpleuce the momentum of the ball is increased. So, the rate of change of momentum of ball is decreased and hence a small force is exerted on the hands of the player and the hands of the player do not get hurt.<br />

<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a) According to Newton&8217;s third law of motion: Whenever one body exerts a force on another body, the second body exerts an equal and opposite force on the first body. In other words, to every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Two examples to illustrate this law-<br />
When a man jumps out from a boat, the boat moves backwards. This is due to the fact that to step out of the boat, the man presses the boat with his foot in the backward direction. The push of the man on the boat is action. The boat exerts an equal force in the forward direction and since the boat is not fixed and is floating, it moves backwards due to the action force exerted by the man.<br />
Gunman gets a jerk on firing a bullet from his gun. This is because when a bullet is fipurple from a gun, the force sending the bullet forward is equal to the force sending the gun backwards but due to high mass of the gun, it moves only a little distance backwards giving a jerk to the gunman.<br />
b) When a fireman directs a powerful stream of water on a fire, the hose pipe tends to go backward due to the reaction force of the water rushing through it in the forward direction at a great speed.</p>

(a) State the law of conservation of momentum.<br />
(b) Discuss the conservation of momentum in each of the following cases :<br />
(i) a rocket taking off from ground.<br />
(ii) flying of a jet aeroplane.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a) According to the law of conservation of momentum: When two (or more) bodies act upon one another, their total momentum remains constant (or conserved) provided no external forces are acting. It means that when one body gains momentum, then some other body loses an equal amount of momentum i.e. momentum is neither created nor destroyed.<br />
b)<br />
a. Rocket taking off from the ground The chemicals inside the rocket burn and produce very high velocity blast of hot gases. These gases pass out through the tail nozzle of the rocket in the downward direction with tremendous speed and the rocket moves up to balance the momentum of the gases. The gases have a very high velocity ang hence a very large momentum. An equal momentum is imparted to the rocket in the opposite direction, so that it goes up with a high velocity.<br />
b. Flying of jet aeroplane<br />
In jet aeroplanes, a large volume of gases produced by the combustion of fuel is allowed to escape through a jet in backward direction. Due to high velocity, the backward rushing gases have a large momentum. They impart an equal and opposite momentum to the jet aeroplane due to which it moves forward with a great speed.</p>

(b) An unloaded truck weighing 2000 kg has a maximum acceleration of 0.5 m/s<sup>2</sup>. What is the maximum acceleration when it is carrying a load of 2000 kg ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
a) If of a balloon filled with compressed air and its mouth untied is released with its mouth in the downward direction, the balloon moves in the upward direction because the air present in the balloon rushes out in the downward direction. The equal and opposite reaction of downward going air pushes the balloon upwards.<br />

The paratroopers roll on landing to increase the time taken to purpleuce the momentum of their body. Thus, the rate of change of momentum is purpleuced and hence less force is exerted on their legs and they do not get hurt.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 53:</strong></span><br />
Why would an aircraft be unable to fly on the moon ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
An aircraft needs air because air moving under the wings of aircraft is strong enough to hold it up and air is also requipurple to burn the fuel in aircraft engines. Since there is no air on moon, an aircraft cannot fly on moon.</p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Question 54:</strong></span><br />
Explain why it is possible for a small animal to fall from a considerable height without any injury being caused when it reaches the ground.<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
It is possible for a small animal to fall from a considerable height without being injupurple because a small animal has small mass, so the momentum produced is less. When the small animal falls to the ground with less momentum, less opposing force of ground acts on it and hence no injury is caused to it</p>

A truck of mass 500 kg moving at 4 m/s collides with another truck of mass 1500 kg moving in the same direction at 2 m/s. What is their common velocity just after the collision if they move off together ?<br />
<span style="color: purple;"><strong>solution :</strong></span><br />
Mass of first truck, m<sub>1</sub>= 500 kg<br />
Speed of first truck, u<sub>1</sub> = 4 m/s<br />
Mass of second truck, m<sub>2</sub> = 1500 kg<br />
Speed of second truck, u<sub>2</sub> =2 m/s<br />
Combined mass of both trucks, m = 1500 + 500 = 2000 kg<br />
Combined velocity v<br />
Acc. to the law of conservation of momentum<br />
m<sub>1</sub>u<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>u<sub>2</sub> = mv<br />
500 x 4 + 1500 x 2 = 2000 x v<br />
