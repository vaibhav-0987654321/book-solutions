Advantages of manures are:<br />
(i) Manures are natural fertilizers.<br />
(ii) Manures are bulky sources of organic matter which supply nutrients in small quantity and organic matter in large quantities.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 07:</span><br />
Limitations of using manures are:<br />
(i) Manures are not nutrient specific.<br />
(ii) Manures are not able to fulfill the high and rapid demand of nutrients required by improved high-yielding hybrid varieties of crops.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 08;</span><br />
Manure contains many organic substances of biological origin which can be easily degraded and absorbed by plants. It helps in recycling of biological waste. Manures increase the fertility of soil for long duration without causing any harm. However, the chemical fertilizers (e.g. urea) improve soil fertility for short duration but cause environmental hazard. Continuous use of fertilizers in a particular area / crop field causes destruction of soil fertility.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 09:</span><br />
Advantages of fertilizer over manure:<br />
(i) Fertilizers are very rich in plant nutrient whereas manure contains small amounts of essential plant nutrients.<br />
(ii) Fertilizers are soluble in water whereas manure is not soluble in water.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 10:</span><br />
As a result of this, the pond water would acquire a high concentration of nitrates and phosphates which would result in the excessive growth of algae and phytoplankton in the pond.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 11:</span><br />
Eutrophication is a process whereby water bodies, such as lakes or slow-moving streams receive excess nutrients that stimulate excessive plant growth (algae, phytoplankton&#8217;s and nuisance plants weeds). This enhanced plant growth is also termed as an algal bloom.<br />
Example: During rains the nutrients from the fields are washed away and get accumulated in nearby water bodies.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 12:</span><br />
The continuous use of chemical fertilizers in a particular area or crop field leads to loss of soil fertility.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 13:</span><br />
There are three methods of fertilizer applications in practice:<br />
(i) Broadcasting: Uniform distribution over the whole cropped field.<br />
(ii) Placement: Application in bands or in pockets near the plants or plant rows.<br />
(iii) Foliar application: Using low or high volume sprayers, the fertilizers are sprayed covering the plants.<br />

Farmyard Manure<br />
It is the decomposed mixture of cattle excreta, dung, urine, litter and left over organism matter such as roughage and Fodder.<br />
Compost Manure<br />
It is prepared from farm and town refuge such as vegetable and animal refuse.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 15:</span><br />
Manure &#8211; Manures are natural fertilizers. They are bulky sources of organic matter which supply nutrients in small quantities, and organic matter in large quantities. There are different types of manures: Farmyard manure (FYM), Compost, Green manures and Vermicompost.<br />
Manures affect the soil in following three ways:<br />
(i) Manures enrich the soil with nutrients. They replenish the general deficiency of nutrients in the soil. Since manure contains fewer nutrients they need to be used in large quantities.<br />
(ii) Manures add organic matter (called humus) to the soil which restores the soil texture, for better retention of water and aeration of soil.<br />
(iii) The organic matter in manures provides food for the soil organisms, (decomposers such as bacteria, fungi, etc. which help in providing nutrients to plants.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 16:</span><br />
Green manuring is the practice which includes growing, mulching by ploughing and mixing of green crops with soil, to improve physical structure and soil fertility.<br />

<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 17:</span><br />
Fertilizers &#8211; Fertilizers are one of the major components for obtaining higher yields especially in expensive farming practices. Fertilizers are divided into following four groups:<br />
(i) Nitrogenous fertilizers &#8211; These fertilizers supply the macronutrient nitrogen.<br />
Example &#8211; Urea, CO(NH2)2<br />
(ii) Potassic fertilizers &#8211; These fertilizers supply potassium which is one of the essential macronutrient of the plants.<br />
Example &#8211; Potassium sulphate, K2SO4.<br />
(iii) Complex fertilizers &#8211; These fertilizers contains two or more nutrients.<br />
Example &#8211; Nitrophosphate<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 18:</span><br />
Biofertilisers &#8211; Organisms which enrich the soil with nutrients are called biofertilisers. Biofertilisers are used for the specific crop plants such as pulses, legumes, oil seeds and rice. They are renewable and non-pollutant sources of plant nutrient such as nitrogen.<br />
Nitrogen fixing microorganisms, i.e., non-symbiotic and symbiotic cyanobacteria and phosphate-solubilising microorganism are the main type of biofertilisers.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 19:</span><br />
A legume crop does not require nitrogenous fertilizers because its roots have root nodules which have nitrogenous bacteria called Rhizobium. This bacteria fixes atmospheric nitrogen and the plants converts nitrogen into various nitrogenous compounds.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 20:</span><br />
Irrigation is essential for the absorption of nutrient elements by the crop plants from the soil. The irrigation water tends to dissolve the nutrients present in the soil of a crop field to form a Solution. This Solution of nutrients is then absorbed by the roots of crops for the development of the plants.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution 21:</span><br />

Manures are rich in organic matter but are poor supplier of nutrients. So, the cultivated field which is not supplied with fertilizers may suffer from the deficiency of nutrients and not give very good yield.<br />
The cultivated field which is supplied with fertilizers only may face drainage problem and water logging due to lack of organic matter in the soil. This may harm the crop and the yield. Use of fertilizers over long periods of time can destroy the soil texture by killing the microorganisms that recycle nutrients in the soil.</p>

Irrigation is the process of supplying water to crop plants by means of canals, wells, reservoirs, tube-wells, etc.<br />
Irrigation is necessary in the areas where there is scarcity and irregular distribution of rain that can cause drought. It provides sufficient moisture for the germination of seeds, as seeds do not germinate in dry soil. It is also necessary for the growth and development of crop plants. The irrigation water tends to dissolve the nutrients present in the soil and forms a Solution which is easily absorbed by the roots of the plants.<br />
Excessive irrigation causes water logging and increases surface salinity. In water logged soil, plants do not get proper aeration.</p>
<p><span style="color: #eb4924;">Solution LAQ &#8211; 5:</span><br />
The various types of irrigation systems are &#8211;<br />
(i) Canal system: In this system, the human-made canals receive water from one or two reservoirs or from rivers. The main canal is distributed into branch canals which have further distributaries or field channels.<br />
(ii) Tanks: These are small storage reservoirs which catch and store the runoff of smaller catchment areas.<br />
(iii) Wells: These are of two types &#8211; dug wells and tube wells. In dug wells, water is collected from water bearing strata. The water from the shallow strata slowly accumulates in the pit and water is lifted by mechanical means. A tube well can tap water from the deeper strata.<br />
(iv) River lift system: It is more useful in the areas where canal flow is insufficient or irregular due to inadequate water release. In this system, water is directly drawn from the rivers for supplement irrigation.<br />
(v) River valley system: Certain parts of the country such as Karnataka and Kerala which lie along the Western Ghats use water that is discharged into the steep and narrow riverine valleys, during the rainy season. The bottom flat lands of the valleys are used for growing crops.<br />
(vi) Drip and sprinkler system: It employs the overhead pipes for spraying water.<br />
Efficiency of applied water can be increased by rain water harvesting and water shed management.</p>

Crop variety improvement is the manipulation of crop plants for increasing their yield and improving quality. Various approaches which are used for genetic improvement of crop plants are referred as plant breeding methods. These involve three processes:<br />
(i) Introduction &#8211; This refers to the transportation of crop plants from the place of cultivation to the place where grown earlier.<br />
(ii) Selection &#8211; This process involves the selection of most desirable offspring of a variety of plant for controlled propagation.<br />
(iii) Hybridisation &#8211; It involves the crossing between genetically dissimilar plants to produce a new kind. Crossing may be between two different varieties (intervarietal cross &#8211; breeding) or between the two different species of the same genus (inter specific cross &#8211; breeding) and between different genera (intergeneric cross &#8211; breeding).<br />
